<div class="faq"><h5><a id="about2-bridge"></a>How does the new bridging feature work?</h5>
<p>Squeezebox2 Wireless has both 802.11g and ethernet connections. When connected wirelessly to an access point in another room, the new bridging
feature allows other devices to connect to the Internet <i>through</i> the Squeezebox2, simply by plugging into its ethernet port. This makes it
easy to connect non-wireless devices (such as a Tivo, Playstation, XBox, or home theatre PC) to a home wireless network.
</p></div>

<div class="faq"><h5><a id="about2-audio"></a>What's new for audiophiles?</h5>
<p>Squeezebox2 features a new design for its audio output stages, which includes components and design aspects usually found only in much more expensive equipment. We
listened to our audiophile customers, and carefully designed both the digital and analog output circuitry for extreme performance. We tested many 
power supply, DAC, and op-amp designs and selected the best configuration using measurements taken with a Dscope Series III audio analyzer. The result is 
an incredible level of <i>measurable</i> performance rivalling much more expensive equipment.
<p>For the analog output stage, we used extensive power supply isolation and filtering, with separate dedicated linear regulators for the DAC and line-out amplification stages. The PCM1748 DAC comes
from Burr-Brown&trade;, a brand widely recognized for high quality and ultra-low distortion levels. Full 6Vpp line-out levels ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio through
to the receiver, and power levels compliant with high-end gear. 
<p>The S/PDIF interface and DAC clocks are driven directly by 
two dedicated crystal oscillator circuits running at fixed frequencies. By contrast, other low-cost devices generally use a PLL circuit to generate multiple clock 
frequencies from a single crystal - this design is less expensive, but it is more susceptible to instability due to power supply noise and environmental factors.
By using dedicated fixed oscillators, Squeezebox2 eliminates the predominant source of jitter and clock imprecision in S/PDIF sources.
<p>In addition to this new hardware, Squeezebox2 uses a new signal processing architecture implemented entirely in software - we call it SlimDSP&trade;. This means that all audio format decoding,
synthesis, filtering, mixing, and attenuation operations are tuneable and upgradeable with firmware. Even all of the audio-releated logic circuitry, such as the encoding of the S/PDIF
output signal and the presentation of data to the DAC, are implemented in a field-upgradeable Xilinx gate array. Squeezebox2 is without a doubt the most capable, configurable, and upgradeable 
networked audio device ever created.</p></div>

<div class="faq"><h5><a id="about2-hwsync"></a>Can I synchronize a Squeezebox2 with my Squeezebox or SLIMP3 players?</h5>
<p>Absolutely.  All three players can be synchronized in the same group.</p></div>

<div class="faq"><h5><a id="about2-swsync"></a>Can I still synchronize Squeezebox2 with SoftSqueeze on my computer?</h5>
<p>Absolutely.  In fact, SoftSqueeze is being updated to behave more like a Squeezebox2 than the original.</p></div>

<div class="faq"><h5><a id="about2-80211"></a>What kind of wireless networks can Squeezebox2 connect to?  Can I connect directly to my computer?</h5>
<p>11 Mbps 802.11b and 54Mbps 802.11g are both supported.  Both infrastructure and ad-hoc modes are supported, so you can
connect to a wireless router, wireless access point, or even directly to a computer that has a wireless network
interface.</p></div>

<div class="faq"><h5><a id="about2-security"></a>What sorts of wireless security features can Squeezebox2 use?  Can I use WEP or WPA?</h5>
<p>Squeezebox2 is compatible with 40/64-bit WEP encryption, 128-bit WEP encryption, and WPA Personal encryption.  MAC address
filtering can also be used on a router for enhanced security.</p></div>

<div class="faq"><h5><a id="about2-hardware"></a>What are the minimum hardware requirements for the server computer?</h5>
<p>We have users with single players using Pentium 166 PCs as servers with 64M of memory. We generally recommend a 300Mhz Pentium II with 128M of memory.  You may also need a faster CPU if you wish to use multiple Squeezeboxes with a single server computer, or if the music library is very large.  Any Macintosh capable of running OS X should be able to be a SlimServer.</p></div>

<div class="faq"><h5><a id="about2-80211impact"></a>What kind of impact will Squeezebox2 have on my wireless network?</h5>
<p>While streaming music, Squeezebox2 will use some network bandwidth. The amount of bandwidth depends on the bitrate of the audio file.  MP3 files use up to 320k bits per second, AIFF, WAV, AAC and other formats may use up to 1.5M bits per second, but since Squeezebox2 supports FLAC, this can be reduced to around 800k bits per second on the fly.  A solid 802.11g network can generally support around 15-20M bits per second of data, even though it's rated for 54M bits per second. This means that you can support more than one Squeezebox2 on an 802.11g network, but the number depends on the audio data rate and how busy the network is otherwise.</p></div>

<div class="faq"><h5><a id="about2-wiredwireless"></a>What's the difference between the wired and wireless models?  Can the wireless model be wired?</h5>
<p>The only difference is that the wired-only model does not have wireless functionality.  It's for installations where
wireless ethernet is either not possible or not necessary, as a cost-saving option.</p></div>

<div class="faq"><h5><a id="about2-crossfade"></a>I read something about a new crossfading feature.  How does that work?</h5>
<p>Squeezebox2 now supports crossfading between tracks.  This smooths out the transition between them so that one song fades in
as the other one is fading out.  It's configurable in Player Settings in the SlimServer web interface, including the length of
time you want the fade to occur over, whether you just want to fade in to tracks, or fade out of them, fade out and in, or to
combine the two and cross-fade.</p></div>

<div class="faq"><h5><a id="about-multiple"></a>Can I use more than one Squeezebox2 with a single server?</h5>
<p>Yes, you can have any number of Squeezeboxes on your LAN, using a single instance of the SlimServer software. Thanks to the efficient design of our software and streaming protocol, even a low-end PC can service more than a dozen Squeezeboxes. Each player operates completely independently of the others, so you can have different music playing in your garage, kitchen, bed room, living room... wherever! In addition, if you have multiple Squeezeboxes, you can synchronize them so that they play back the same audio in every room of your house.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="about-softsqueeze"></a>Can I play the same audio Squeezebox2 is playing on my computer at the same time, synchronized?</h5>
<p>Yes, this is possible through a program by Richard Titmuss named SoftSqueeze.  Please note that SoftSqueeze is written in Java and requires
Java 1.5 in order to synchronize, but for more information <a href="http://softsqueeze.sourceforge.net/">please see Richard's SoftSqueeze web site</a>.  SoftSqueeze is also now included in SlimServer.  For more information on this, see the <a href="http://softsqueeze.sourceforge.net/download.html#webstart">WebStart documentation</a>.</p>
</div>


<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="about-display"></a>The fluorescent display looks great, but aren't those pretty expensive? Have you considered using a cheaper LCD display?</h5>
<p>We simply are not willing to compromise on the Squeezebox2's interface. We evaluated several LCD displays from different manufacturers, but none came remotely close to the VFD in brightness and readability. Many were completely unreadable at a distance of just five feet. Fluorescent displays cost a bit more, and you get what you pay for!</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="about-dhcp"></a>Does Squeezebox2 support DHCP?</h5>
<p>Yes, Squeezebox2 supports both DHCP and static IP addresses. It also has a feature called Slim Discovery Protocol, which automatically locates the SlimServer on your network. For LANs which already have a DHCP server, Squeezebox2 is ready to run out-of-the-box, without having to do any configuration. If you don't have DHCP, you can enter the IP addresses manually.</p>
</div>


<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="about-cable"></a>What kind of ethernet cable do I need? How long can it be?</h5>

<p>Since Squeezebox2's ethernet interface is 10/100 ethernet, you can use CAT3, CAT5, CAT5e, or CAT6 ethernet cable.
If you are connecting directly to a computer you will need a crossover cable, otherwise a regular straight cable will work just fine. 
 (Note: <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=42717">Some Macintosh computers</a> will work with either a regular or crossover cable.)  The maximum length for 10base-T and 100base-T cables is 100 meters or about 328 feet, assuming that the appropriate type of wire is used and it is laid correctly.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="about-os"></a>Which operating systems are supported?</h5>
<p>Squeezebox2 and SlimServer is officially supported under Windows NT/2000/XP, Linux, and Mac OS X. It is also known to work on a wide variety of other operating systems, so it's safe to say that just about any modern OS will be compatible. Squeezebox2 has been tested on all of the following platforms:</p>
<p>BeOS, FreeBSD, Linux (X86, PPC, and MIPS), Mac OS X, NetBSD (X86), OpenBSD, Solaris (X86, Sparc), Windows NT, 2000, XP</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="about-source"></a>How can I get the source to the SlimServer software?</h5>
<p>The SlimServer software is Open Source (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>) and available for download from <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/dev_resources.html">the Slim Devices website</a>. If you make any improvements, we encourage you to post them to our <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/slimp3-dev/">developers list</a> so that they can be shared with the rest of our community and possibly added to the standard release.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="about-crossover"></a>Can I connect Squeezebox2 directly to my computer (without a hub)?</h5>
<p>Yes, you can connect the player directly to your computer using an Ethernet crossover cable. You can purchase a crossover cable at most retail computer stores. Once you have this connection, you'll need to set up your network adaptor and Squeezebox2 with static IP addresses so that they can find each other.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="about-220"></a>220V power supply? Will you ship internationally?</h5>
<p>Squeezebox2 includes a regulated power supply with the correct plug style and input voltage for your shipping destination.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="about-amp"></a>Does Squeezebox2 have an integrated amplifier?</h5>
<p>Squeezebox2 has a small built-in amplifier which will power standard headphones of at least 16 ohms. The 1/8&quot; headphone output is also ideal for connecting  powered speakers. For large speakers, an external amplifier or receiver is required.
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="about-spdif"></a>Does Squeezebox2 have a digital S/PDIF output (Coax or TOSlink)?</h5>
<p>Yes!  <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_specs.html">Both!</a></p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="about-alarm"></a>Can I use Squeezebox2 as an alarm clock?</h5>
<p>Yes! Squeezebox2 can play daily alarms with music of your choice.  Additionally, Squeezebox2 can connect to SqueezeNework to provide an alarm clock to wake you with your choice of compatible Internet radio stations and over 80 environmental and musical sounds.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="about-id3"></a>Does Squeezebox2 use file names or ID3 tags?</h5>
<p>Squeezebox2 lets you browse your collection by file name or by ID3 tags.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="about-random"></a>Does Squeezebox2 have a random mode?</h5>
<p>Yes. Squeezebox2 lets you play MP3s by artist, album, genre, from a playlist, by file, from a single folder, or from a folders of folders. You can shuffle the list at any time, add new songs to the list of songs and unshuffle to play them in order.</p>

</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="about-remoteuse"></a>Can the signal from the remote control be used for other things?</h5>
<p>Squeezebox2 sends the decoded IR signals directly to the server. It's possible to write plug-ins for the server that can control other programs or network devices from your computer.</p>

</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="setup-reenter"></a>Do I have to re-enter the IP address configuration when Squeezebox2 is power-cycled?</h5>

<p>No, you only have to enter it once. Squeezebox2 stores its configuration internally in flash memory. In the event of a power outage, Squeezebox2 will automatically connect to the server when the power comes back on, using its stored settings.</p>


</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="setup-service"></a>How do I stop the SlimServer service that's running in the background on my Windows NT/2000/XP system?</h5>

<p>From the Administrative Tools folder, choose Services.  You should see an entry in your service list for SlimServer.  Right-click on it and choose STOP to stop the service.  Right-click on it again to choose to start it.</p>

</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="setup-preferencefile"></a>Where is my Preferences File?</h5>	

<p>The location varies depending on the operating system you are using. The file which is 
found first will be the one that is used and changes will be written back 
out to this file.</p>

<p><b>Windows:</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The file will be c:\Program Files\SlimServer\server\slimserver.pref</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Mac OS:</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The file is called slimserver.pref and located in $HOME/Library/SlimDevices</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Linux:</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The server will use whichever file you specify on the command line using the --prefsfile option. If you use the supplied init.d script, this forces the file to be /etc/slimserver.conf .</p>

<p>If no options are specified and the file /etc/slimserver.conf exists, it will be used, otherwise the file will be called .slimserver.pref and located in the home directory of the user running the Slim Server.</p>
</blockquote>

</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="setup-whattagdatabase"></a>What is the Tag Database?</h5>	

<p>Instead of reading tags out of files every time the server is restarted, the
tag database saves the data to a file and uses this when loading to speed up
server start-up. This data is also used to speed up rescans.</p>


</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="setup-tagwherestore"></a>Where does the Tag Database store it's data?</h5>	

<p>The data is stored in the same folder as the preferences file. Under
Windows/Mac it will be called slimserversql.db. Under unix it will be called
.slimserversql.db and stored in the home directory of the user running the Slim
Server.</p>


</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="setup-tagfileformat"></a>What file format does the Tag Database use?</h5>	

<p>The data is saved using <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> and is in that binary format.
If you want external access to this data, we plan to export it as an XML file similar in format to 
the iTunes file but this has not been implemented yet.</p>

</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="setup-rescanvswipecache"></a>What is the difference between the "Rescan" and "Wipe Cache" buttons?</h5>

<p>The Rescan button should find any changes made to you music library. When
the Tag Database is being used, it is possible that data in the cache
can be corrupt. If that is the case, the "Wipe Cache" button can be used to
make the server rebuild everything from scratch.</p>

</div>


<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="formats-aac"></a>Does Squeezebox2 support AAC?</h5>

<p>Yes.  Unprotected AAC files (.m4a) that are created by iTunes can be played on Squeezebox2.  Squeezebox2's hardware decoder supports MP3 and uncompressed formats for decoding.  Under Mac OS X and Windows, SlimServer can uncompress AAC files and send th

e raw audio to the Squeezebox2 on-the-fly.</p>
<p>For use on some wireless networks where there is not enough bandwidth to stream uncompressed audio, <a href=#troubleshooting-aacwireless>please refer to this FAQ entry</a>.
<p>Please note that music purchased from the iTunes Music Store (&quot;Protected AAC&quot; (.m4p) files) is encrypted and cannot be played back with Squeezebox2 until Apple provides the necessary hooks to enable this. In the meantime, it is possible to bu

rn your iTunes Music Store songs to CD and re-rip them as unprotected .m4a files.</p>

</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="formats-linuxaac"></a>Does Squeezebox2 support AAC on Linux systems?</h5>

<p>Yes! SlimServer supports all of the popular MP3 streaming protocols, including HTTP, Icecast/Shoutcast, and Live365.</p>


</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="formats-playlists"></a>Does Squeezebox2 support playlists?</h5>

<p>Yes, Squeezebox2 has a sophisticated, easy-to-use playlist management system. It lets you easily create playlists from the remote control or the web interface. In addition, Squeezebox2 can use .m3u and .pls files.</p>


</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="formats-cue"></a>Does Squeezebox2 support CUE files?</h5>

<p>Yes. CUE files are interpreted as playlists containging a number of songs, corresponding to the tracks within a single MP3 file. CUE files can also be used to refer to index points within a single MP3 song.</p>

</p>

</div>


<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="formats-transcode"></a>How do I get other file formats (transcoding) to work?</h5>
<p>You need to download the programs needed to convert between the file
formats. You then install these as detailed in the next question so the Slim
Server can find them.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="formats-binarywhere"></a>Where do I put the lame, oggtools or other transcoding programs?</h5>
<p>Under Windows, they should be placed in the C:\Program
Files\SlimServer\server\Bin or the C:\Windows folder.</p>
<p>On the Mac, you can place executable programs in your Library/SlimDevices/bin folder, or in the system path.</p>
<p>Under linux they should be placed in the system path. That probably means /usr/local/bin. Most rpm packages will take care of that for you.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="formats-tcodeversions"></a>Which versions of the transcoding programs should I use?</h5>

<p>As these programs evolve, the options that can be passed to them change. 
Generally you should always try to use the most recent version of a program 
you can find. Specific cases known about are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>ffmpeg: at least version 0.4.7 as prior versions do not have support for required options.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="networking">Networking</a></h4>


<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="networking-firewall"></a>How do I set up my firewall to allow Squeezebox2 to communicate with the server?</h5>

<p><b>Macintosh:</b>
You will have to create a new  exception in the built-in firewall to allow the Squeezebox2 to connect to Slim Server.  To do this:
<ol>
<li>Open System Preferences -> Sharing, and click 'Firewall'
<li>Click 'New...' to create a new rule
<li>For 'Port Name:' specify 'Other'
<li>For 'Port Number, Range or Series:' specify '3483, 9000'
<li>For 'Description:', specify 'Slim Server'
<li>Click [OK], and ensure that your new exception is checked on.
</ol>

<p><b>Windows:</b>  Windows XP Service Pack 2 turns on a built-in firewall by default.  You will need to configure the firewall to allow access to Slim Server.  To do this:
<ol>
	<li>Go to Control Panel
	<li>Click Security Center
	<li>Click Windows Firewall under 'Manage security settings for:'
	<li>Click the Exceptions tab
</ol>

<p>You will then need to add three exceptions for these ports by clicking 'Add Port...':
<ul>
	<li>Port number: 3483 (TCP) - Name: SlimServer Control
	<li>Port number: 3483 (UDP) - Name: SlimDiscovery
	<li>Port Number: 9000 (TCP) - Name: SlimServer Web
</ul>

<p><b>Third-party Firewalls:</b> Examples of third party software firewalls include: Brickhouse, Norton Personal Firewall, Norton Security Center, PC-Cillin, BlackIce, McAfee Security Center, ZoneAlarm.  You will need to configure your firewall software o

r hardware to allow connections to ports 3483, 9000 and 9090 for both UDP and TCP connections.  Refer to the instructions that came with your firewall for details.</p>
</p>
</div>


<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="nas"></a>Can I use a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device with my Squeezebox2?</h5>

<p>The SlimServer software must be running in order to use the Squeezebox2, with the exception of using SqueezeNetwork.  So if the NAS device in question can have programs installed on it (for example the Cobalt Qube), then it is supported.  If the NAS device can not have programs installed on it, 

then you can still store your music files on a NAS device, but you'll still need SlimServer running on a computer with access to that device.</p>

<h4><a id="remote"></a>Using the Remote Control</h4>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="remote-universal"></a>How can I control Squeezebox2 with my universal remote?</h5>

<p>Squeezebox2 will respond to the infrared signals intended for a JVC DVD player. The instructions that came with your remote control tell you how to program your remote to send these codes. If you have a Philips Pronto remote, check the <a href="http://

www.slimdevices.com/dev_plugins.html">Plugins</a> page on the Slim Devices website for some pre-programmed screens for this remote.</p>


</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="remote-removesong"></a>How do I remove a song from my &quot;Now Playing&quot; playlist with the remote control? How do I clear the whole playlist?</h5>

<p>To remove a song from the &quot;Now Playing&quot; playlist, navigate to the &quot;Now Playing&quot; menu, scroll to that song in the playlist, then press the ADD button. If you press and hold the ADD button, the displayed song will be removed from the playlist and added to a special Saved Playlist called &quot;Zapped Songs&quot; for you to review later. To clear the whole playlist, navigate to the &quot;Squeezebox2 Home&quot; menu and scroll down until it says &quot;Now Playing&quot; on the second line. Press the ADD button and your playlist will be emptied.</p>

</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="remote-otherremotes"></a>Why does my Squeezebox2 react when I'm controlling my DVD player?</h5>
<p>You may need to disable a remote for the Squeezebox2 in the same room as that DVD player.  Go to Player Settings -> Remote and deselect the remote file that corresponds to your DVD player.</p>

<h4><a id="advanced">Advanced Features</a></h4>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="advanced-streamout"></a>Is it possible to stream from SlimServer to my computer using MP3 player software like WinAmp or iTunes?</h5>

<p>Yes. Open this URL with your player application: <a href="http://localhost:9000/stream.mp3">http://localhost:9000/stream.mp3</a>. (Replace &quot;localhost&quot; with the IP address of the computer that's acting as a server.) This will start the streaming from SlimServer. Initially, this will just be silence. Now use the web interface to control SlimServer. You'll see a new &quot;player&quot; corresponding to the IP address of the computer that's being streamed to. Now use the SlimServer web interface to browse and click on &quot;Play&quot; to choose some music to play back. You'll hear that music after a couple of seconds delay, due to buffering in the MP3 player software. If you are using SlimServer's password security, you'll need to use a slightly modified URL like this: <a href="http://username:password@localhost:9000/stream.mp3">http://username:password@localhost:9000/stream.mp3</a>.</p>


</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="advanced-urls"></a>What are some of the URLs I can use to access special features on Squeezebox2 and SlimServer?</h5>

<p>Replace &quot;localhost&quot; in the following URLs with the IP address of your SlimServer computer.</p>

	<dt>To display text on Squeezebox2:
	<dd><a href="http://localhost:9000/status.txt?p0=display&amp;p1=Firstline&amp;p2=secondline&amp;p3=5">http://localhost:9000/status.txt?p0=display&amp;p1=Firstline&amp;p2=secondline&amp;p3=5</a>

</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="advanced-httpcli"></a>Can I control Squeezebox2 in other ways, besides using SlimServer and the remote control?</h5>

<p>Yes. Squeezebox2 has both an HTTP interface and a command-line style interface so you can control the player from your own scripts or from the command line. See the Technical Information section on the online documentation.</p>

</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="advanced-dab"></a>Can I stream DAB broadcasts to Squeezebox2?</h5>
<p>Yes, with a Psion Wavefinder.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="advanced-dabhowto"></a>How do I set up Squeezebox2 with a Psion Wavefinder?</h5>

<p>These "get you going" notes are based on using another application called DABBar to control the Wavefinder. We have heard that WinDAB <a href="http://www.windab.co.uk">http://www.windab.co.uk</a> works, although you might not be able to retune the Wavefinder directly from Squeezebox2 across multiplexes using WinDAB. Perhaps someone could post on that. DABBar does not need to be on the same machine as your SlimServer.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Download the latest version of DABBar from <a href="http://www.dabbar.co.uk">www.dabbar.co.uk</a>. Install and check that it all works as expected.
	<li>Make sure you can access the inbuilt DABBar webserver from your machine using an address of http://localhost:8080&mdashthe last bit is the port that the server is running on and can be set from the http server tab in the DABBar Options. What you set 

it to is not critical; 8080 is a favourite standard choice.
	<li>Now try http://192.168.1.100:8080 replacing the ip address (192.168.1.100) with the ip address of your machine. This will help later in the cut and paste operations. You should see the same page as before.
	<li>There are two tidy ways to incorporate radio stations within Squeezebox2: either you can create a file for each station and place them in your playlists folder on the SlimServer, or you can add several (or all) stations to one playlist (.pls) file and place that in your playlists folder. If you do the latter, then we suggest you name the file DABRadio or something similar. Then from the Squeezebox2 &quot;Saved Playlists&quot; menu you can press RIGHT to navigate into the playlist folder and press RIGHT again to navigate into the DABRadio playlist, then choose which station to play. When you select it the Wavefinder will retune automatically and start to play that station.
	<li>Create a blank text document with NotePad or a similar text editor.
	<li>Currently displayed in your web browser should be a list of all the stations that you can currently receive. Now I'm afraid for a little tedious copying of information. First we will create a single file for one station. RIGHT click on the top statio

n name (in my case 1Xtra &#150; BBC) and select `copy shortcut' &#150; now move to your blank text document and paste the link there &#150; probably something like http://192.168.1.100:8080/49706.m3u - the last 5 digit number is the crucial &quot;ID&quot; 
 of the station and is the only bit of information that changes between all the different stations. Now you must alter the .m3u on the end of the pasted text to .mp2 so your text file now contains http://192.168.1.100:8080/49706.mp2 Save the text file with a name of &quot;1Xtra.m3u&quot;- note the extension .m3u. For each station that you want to receive you will have to create a text file , paste in the link, change the end bit and save it with a .m3u extension.
	<li>Now move this newly created file into your playlist directory on your SlimServer. It is not necessary to stop and start the server.
	<li>You should now be able to select the Squeezebox2's &quot;Saved Playlists&quot; menu , press right arrow and using the up and down arrow you should find your new file. If you press play when it is selected (DABBar must be running) you should be reward

ed with the station playing from Squeezebox2, it may take a couple of seconds to tune in the Wavefinder.
	<li>For each station that you want to receive you should repeat the above steps 5) to 8).
	<li>Creating one playlist file allows all the stations to be incorporated in one file. It also allows the stations to be named in the file which may be useful later, (he said hopefully). Again create a blank text file with NotePad and create a document that looks like this below. We have chosen to include the first 4 stations. Note that the pasted links from your DABBar web page still have the .m3u replaced with .mp2

	<li>Then save this file as say &quot;DABRadio.pls&quot; &#150; note the .pls extension, that's what makes it a recognisable as a playlist file. Again put this file into your SlimServers playlist directory and now you can select &quot;Saved Playlists&quot; and press right arrow, use the up and down arrows to find the new &quot;DABRadio&quot; file and you can press right arrow again to `navigate' into the file &#150; once within the file you can use the up and down arrows again to select and then play a station. If you have a lot of items already in your playlists folder this tidies all the DAB radio stations into one place. The title information that's in the playlist file is not currently fully utilised by Squeezebox2. It appears to select the station and then remains for a while on the bottom line of the Squeezebox2 display.
	<li>In version 1.4 of DABBar the metadata information or extra radiotext information transmitted by the station is relayed to Squeezebox2 and scrolls along the bottom line of the display. This currently overwrites the station name from the playlist. This is the same information that scrolls across the bottom of the DABBar display on the DABBar window on your PC. Version 1.4 is in `beta test' currently &#150; keep watching the DABBar site for more information. - or contact me offlist.
	<li>So &#150; before anyone asks the obvious &#150; can you listen to different stations on different Squeezebox2's or on your PC ?? Surprisingly the answer is YES ! as long as the stations are on the same multiplex. On the DABBar web page http://localhost:8080 you will see a column showing you on which multiplex the stations are located &#150; I can currently receive three different multiplexes. All the BBC stations for example are on one multiplex. I guess you may even be able to leave your Wavefinder running at home and listen to your local station with your Squeezebox2 on the beach !
	<li>Finally &#150; there is a record option within DABBar allowing you to save the stream to disk. Just select `Record' by right clicking on the station banner and chose a filename and MPEG Audio (Layer 2) &#150; and away you go. Stop the recording and then move the file to your Squeezebox2 and you can play it ! There is an interface to DigiGuide too allowing you to schedule recordings so that they happen in your absence &#150; it just keeps getting better.
</ol>

<p>Hope that helps a few &#150; we are truly fortunate that Slim Devices provided mp2 capability within Squeezebox2 (thanks guys) &#150; one of the few players that does &#150; and also an ability to play 48Khz bitrates &#150; again one of the few players to do this. If you managed to buy your Wavefinder at one of the recent discounted prices you have ended up with an awesome solution based on two very capable products that know nothing about each joining as one. Now how often does that happen ??? My thanks to Alistair MacDonald, author of DabBar for the magic that makes it all work !</p>

<p>We have pasted my complete playlist file below &#150; maybe Slim Devices have a place on their website to store it as a downloadable file. While my station list will be somewhat different to yours I think that most of the stations are national and the ID's are consistent.</p>

<p>My local multiplex TWG-EMPA W.Yorks offers Classic Gold KISS Sunrise Radio and The Pulse so these probably won't work for you unless you're in Yorkshire ! Just paste the following into a text file and name it DABRadio.pls. If your Wavefinder is on the same PC as your SlimServer then tit should works as is &#150; pop it in your Playlists file on SlimServer and navigate into the file, select and play ! If it's on a different PC then search and replace &quot;localhost&quot; by &quot;192.168.1.100&quot; or whatever ip address your Wavefinder is on and then save and move the file. There should be 24 replacements. Happy listening - Kevin</p>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="advanced-plugins"></a>How do I add Plugins to the SlimServer software?</h5>
<p>Some Squeezebox2 owners have written &quot;Plugins&quot; for the SlimServer software that add functionality beyond what comes with the SlimServer software. A few of these have been included with the latest version of the SlimServer software.</p>

<p>To turn on the Plugins menu on Squeezebox2, use the &quot;Server Settings&quot; web page and click on the Additional Server Settings link at the bottom of the page. Then click on &quot;Add&quot;, next to the listing for the Plugins menu on this page.</p>

<p>You can find some of these plugins <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/dev_plugins.html">here</a> on the Slim Devices website. To install these files, download them with your web browser and place them in the folder named &quot;Plugins&quot; that's inside your &quot;server&quot; folder. Double-check that the files have a &quot;.pm&quot; at the end of the file name. Now reboot or restart your server software. The new functions should appear in your Plugins menu.</p>

<p>Mac users: The Plugins folder is hidden within the SlimServer preference pane. Look in either the folder named Library at the top level of your hard disk or the Library folder in your Home folder. Inside one of these folders you should find a folder called &quot;SlimServer.prefPane&quot;. Control-click on this folder and choose &quot;Show Package Contents&quot;, then open the &quot;contents&quot; folder, then the &quot;server&quot; folder, then the for a folder called &quot;Plugins&quot;. Place the downloaded plugins files in this folder.  <b>Note:</b> If you upgrade your SlimServer software, you'll need to re-install any plugins you may have added.</p>

<p>Windows Users: The Plugins folder is installed by default here: C:\Program Files\SlimServer\server\Plugins</p>

<h5><a id="troubleshooting-nortonantivirus"></a>I just upgraded Norton Antivirus and my Squeezebox2 stopped working.</h5>
	<p>Norton Antivirus 2005 has a feature called Internet Worm Protection, which is a firewall of sorts.  Even when SlimServer is set as an exception, it may still block players from connecting.</p>
	<p>You may just need to disable this feature, since there is no known way at this time to get around this problem.</p>

<h5><a id="troubleshooting-wireless"></a>My Squeezebox2 seems to lose its wireless connection quite often.  
What can I do to make the wireless connection more stable?</h5>

<p>
There are several things you can do.  Please note that if you are hearing audio dropouts, these settings may not affect this performance.  This FAQ just contains some tips on how to optimize your network.  If you are hearing audio dropouts with AAC audio,

 <a href="#troubleshooting-aacwireless">please see this FAQ entry.</a>  First off, here are some basic things that anyone can do:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Ensure that you have the latest firmware for your wireless access point.  Vendors often make fixes to improve their wireless capabilities after a product has first shipped, so it's good to keep it up-to-date.

	<li>Try restarting your wireless access point/router and see if its behavior improves after the restart.  If it does, it's possible that there is a hardware malfunction in the WAP/router that may need addressing.

	<li>Try reorienting the antenna of the Squeezebox2.  The most effective way to do this is to restart your Squeezebox2 by holding down the power button for 5 seconds.  When it says "Welcome to Squeezebox2" press the right button on the remote.  Instead of going into "Setup networking", press up to go to "View Current Settings"--then press right and find the Wireless signal strength.  With this on the display, you can move the antenna around to see what orientation gives you the best signal strength at the player's location.
	
	<li>Try to keep both your Squeezebox2 and your access point somewhat free of obstacles.  If you have the Squeezebox2 inside a wood and glass entertainment center, try placing it on top of the unit.  If your access point is under a desk, try putting it on top of the desk.  Either of these can make a large improvement.
	
	<li>Try a more directional antenna, and point it directly towards your access point.  There are several available at stores like Fry's, Best Buy, or other similar stores.  The Squeezebox2 has a reverse-polarity SMA connector, so many off-the-shelf antenn as will work.  Some of our users have reported success with D-Link and Hawking Technologies antennas.
</ul>
</p>

<p>Now for some more advanced troubleshooting:</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>On Windows you can use a program called <a href="http://www.netstumbler.com">Netstumbler</a> to find out more about nearby networks.  On MacOS, you can use a program called <a href="http://www.macstumbler.com">MacStumbler</a>.  Both of these excellent tools will give you knowledge to do the following steps...
	
	<li>Ensure that your access point does not overlap with any nearby stations on any channels.  For more information on channel overlap see this <a href="http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/wireless-guide.html">informative guide</a>.
	
	<li>If you are an area with a lot of wireless networks and can not avoid a channel overlap, try to put your access point on a station with very low signal strength as reported by one of the above tools.
	
	<li>If your Squeezebox2 is in close proximity to the access point but you are seeing low signal strength, you may want to try lowering the transmit rate (sometimes called Multicast Rate) on the access point.  Some access points default to a high rate (up to 11Mbps), but you get a stronger signal from higher distances if this value is lower (1-2 Mbps)...
	
	<li>You can also try enabling interference robustness on your access point if supported.  This may decrease range, but should improve your signal.
</ul>

<h5><a id="troubleshooting-sp2"></a>I installed Windows XP Service Pack 2, and my SliMP3 or Squeezebox2 no longer find Slim Server.</h5>

<p>Windows XP Service Pack 2 turns on a built-in firewall by default.  You will need to configure the firewall to allow access to Slim Server.  To do this:
<ol>
	<li>Go to Control Panel
	<li>Click Security Center
	<li>Click Windows Firewall under 'Manage security settings for:'
	<li>Click the Exceptions tab
</ol>

 <p>You will then need to add three exceptions for these ports by clicking 'Add Port...':

<h5><a id="troubleshooting-sleep"></a>After several minutes my player turns off and stops responding.  What's going on?</h5>

<p>Make sure that your energy saver settings on your computer are set so that your computer doesn't go to sleep.  If it does, your player will go to sleep as well.</p>
<p>If you installed SlimServer to not start up automatically, and are using a screen saver on Windows, this can halt the server as well.  If that's the case, it's recommended to reinstall SlimServer to start automatically.
<p>If that's not the problem, make sure that the IP address on your computer isn't changing.  To do this, adjust  your TCP/IP settings to use a static IP address.</a>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="troubleshooting-wep"></a>I'm having trouble connecting my Squeezebox2 to a wireless network with WEP enabled.</h5>

<p>Double check that the WEP key that you have entered is correct.   

<p>If you have an Apple Airport Basestation, you may need to use Apple Airport Admin to obtain your WEP key in the hex format that the Squeezebox2 expects, 
it's available under the Base Station menu item Equivalent Network Password.

<p>Also, make sure that your access point is configured to use Shared-Key Authentication, 
not Open-System Authentication.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="troubleshooting-aacwireless"></a>I'm trying to play AAC files on my Squeezebox2 over a wireless network and the audio sometimes pauses or breaks up.</h5>

<p>This may be caused by insufficient speed in your wireless network.  Here's why:

<p>By default SlimServer will uncompress AAC files on the server side and send the uncompressed audio to the Squeezebox2.  
Uncompressed audio at 16-bit resolution with 44.1kHz sampling rate, stereo, ends up around 1600 kilobits per second&mdash;
as opposed to the compressed AAC bitrate which is typically around 128 kilobits per second.</p> 

<p>When operating wirelessly on both ends of the network (i.e. wireless from computer -> base station, and base station -> Squeezebox2), 
 that data rate doubles.   So you're trying to send more than 3 megabits per second over 802.11b.</p>

<p>In theory, this should not be a problem, but it can be in the real world. 
802.11b has an absolute maximum data rate of 11 megabits per second.  
Typical throughput to a given wireless client on an 802.11b network rarely ever exceeds 3-5 megabits per second.</p>

<p>For better AAC performance over wireless, you can reconfigure the server to convert the AAC audio to a very high quality MP3 format.  To do this, you'll first need to install an MP3 encoder called LAME. 
<p>Mac Users: 
<ul>
<li>Download the <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/apps/index.html?iTunes-LAME/index.html">iTunes-LAME plugin</a>, and drag the iTunes-LAME program from the top left to the bottom right alias (following the arrow).
</ul>
<p>Windows Users:
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="http://mitiok.cjb.net">LAME 3.96 from one of these mirror sites</a>
<li>Extract two files <strong>LAME.EXE</strong> and <strong>LAME_ENC.DLL</strong> and copy them to C:\Program Files\SlimServer\server\bin\
</ul>
</p><p>Then in Player Settings for your Squeezebox2, set a Bitrate Limit of 320, and you should notice an improvement.</p>
</ul>

<h5><a id="troubleshooting-audio"></a>There's something wrong with the audio quality. I hear buzzing and clicks. How can I fix this?</h5>

<p>Make sure that the audio cables are connected firmly to both Squeezebox2 and your amplifier. Also, make sure you aren't using the &quot;phono&quot; input on your amplifier, as it may have the wrong impedance. Finally, try to keep the volume level on the output of Squeezebox2 as high as possible and use the volume control on your amplifier whenever possible. This will reduce the loudness of any analog noise or interference by keeping the output levels from Squeezebox2 as high as possible.</p>

<h5><a id="troubleshooting-sharedvolume"></a>I'm having trouble using a network shared volume as my music library on Windows. It says that the path isn't valid. What's up?</h5>

<p>If you are running on Windows NT, 2000 or XP, SlimServer is running as Windows service.  
Windows services do  not have permission to use networked drives by default.  
You will need to run the SlimServer service as a user who has permission to use the shared volume.
To do this, visit Control Panels -> Administrative Tools -> Services.  Find SlimServer and 
double-click to view the properties.   Click on the Log On tab, then click This Account and 
enter the account information for the user account that has access to the network volume.  
(Note: The user account for the service must be protected by a password for this to work.)
</p>
<p>
If you are still having problems, or are using Windows 98, try using a UNC-style path to specify 
your music library in 
the Server Settings page. Instead of X:\path for a mounted volume, use \\SERVER\path\ style 
addressing. This may work for some servers where direct volume letter mapping does not.

<h5><a id="troubleshooting-rh9"></a>I can't seem to get the SlimServer software to run under RedHat Linux 9.0. There's an error about &quot;Time::HiRes&quot; when it starts up.</h5>

<p>The default installation of Perl on RH9 doesn't include Time::HiRes as it should. There's a binary perl-Time-HiRes-1.38-3.i386.rpm RPM on disk 2 of the RedHat install that works fine and is what you need to get the SlimServer software running under RH9. I also found a copy on the net that worked for me. As root, use this command to install it from the net:</p>

<p>rpm -i http://www.slimdevices.com/downloads/misc/perl-Time-HiRes-1.38-3.i386.rpm</p>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="troubleshooting-lockup"></a>A while after the SlimServer software starts, it locks up or starts using a huge amount of memory and CPU, even without playing any music. What's up?</h5>

<p>Check to make sure that any playlists in your music library contain valid paths to music files in your library. Playlists that refer to themselves or other folders in your library, or playlist entries that refer to disks that aren't available can cause the SlimServer software to get confused.</p>

<p>If this isn't the problem, try moving all of your music files out of the library and then move them back in groups and restarting the server. Try to find, by process of elimination, which files are confusing the SlimServer software.</p>

<p>If you have a very large music library, it can take a long time to scan and possibly use up a lot of memory.  There are a couple of tricks you can use to optimize this process though.  Try disabling Album Artwork in &quot;Server Settings&quot;, &quot;Additional Server Settings&quot;, &quot;Performance&quot;.  Also enable MP3 Tag Caching.</p>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="troubleshooting-windowservice"></a>I'm using the SlimServer as a Windows service but the performance isn't good. The music sometimes is choppy and the menus aren't very responsive, especially when it's scanning my music library. What can I do?</h5>

<p>By default, Windows doesn't give high priority to services and the SlimServer software sometimes needs a fair amount of CPU. To work around this, open your &quot;Control Panels&quot;, and then open the &quot;System&quot; control panel. On the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab, find the &quot;Performance&quot; section and click on &quot;Settings&quot;. On the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab, choose &quot;Backround Services&quot; under &quot;Processor Scheduling&quot;. Click &quot;OK&quot; and the SlimServer software will now get more CPU cycles and perform better.</p>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="troubleshooting-itunes-windows"></a>How do I access my iTunes playlists if I am using iTunes on Microsoft Windows?</a></h5>

<p>If SlimServer doesn't find your iTunes Music Library, it may not show iTunes as a choice in the Server Settings area.
In order to have Slim Server access your iTunes Library on Windows, you may need to:
<ol>
<li>Set your music folder in Slim Server's Server Settings to the folder iTunes keeps its xml database in.  (Usually C:\Documents and Settings\Your-Username\My Documents\My Music\iTunes\) and click Change.</li>
<li>Click the refresh button in the browser.</li>
<li>Go back into Server Settings and an 'Use iTunes' option will appear.  Select it and click Change again.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Now your iTunes playlists should show up under Saved Playlists on the player and in the web interface.

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="troubleshooting-itunes"></a>Some of the songs in my iTunes library don't show up on Squeezebox2 or say STOPPED when I try to play them.  What's with that?</h5>

<p>If you've moved your iTunes music files around, iTunes can export incorrect information about the songs in its library. You'll need to make sure that iTunes has the correct folder for your music library.  Visit the iTunes Preferences and click on Advanced.  If the path to your Music Library folder is incorrect, you'll need to fix it.  If it is correct, try changing it to a different folder and then change it back to the correct folder.  iTunes will then update the paths to all your music and export that data correctly.  (This process won't move any of your music, but it will force iTunes to scan your music library and update the paths to all the songs.)</p>

<p>One other problem that Mac users might encounter is that under Panther, external drives don't automatically get mounted at startup time until the user logs in.  This means that if you don't have automatic logon turned on and you keep your music on an external drive, the SlimServer won't be able to find your music files.  One way to get around this is to set  SlimServer to start at login.  Another, more complicated, solution is listed <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20031103155828117">here</a>.</p>

<p>If this doesn't resolve your problem, iTunes might get confused if you changed the "Keep Music Folder Organized" or "Add Track Number" settings in iTunes.   Try changing them and then changing them back to have iTunes update the correct information about your music files.</p>

<div class="faq">
<h5><a id="troubleshooting-mtu"></a>When my SLIMP3 plays a song, it sounds jittery, chirpy, or distorted, like the song is being fast-forwarded or skipping. What could cause this?</h5>

<p>There is probably a problem with the MTU setting for your network interface. VPN clients such as the Cisco VPN client utility may change your machine's MTU setting from the default. This causes the fast-stuttering on the SLIMP3. If you have the Cisco client installed, run the included Set MTU utility and change the MTU setting to &quot;default&quot; for your network adapter. Reboot your machine to implement the change.</p>

<p>If you aren't using the Cisco VPN client, then check the settings for your network interface and make sure that the MTU is set to 1500. There is some additional information for changing your MTU setting <a href="http://www.winguides.com/registry/displa

y.php/280/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Another approach is to visit the SlimServer software web page for Server Settings -&gt; Additional Server Settings -&gt; Network and change the setting for &quot;Maximum number of bytes of audio data to send to player in a UDP packet&quot; to a lower number. Note that this approach will reduce the efficiency of your network.</p>

	<li>If you have any firewall software installed, configure it to allow communications between your server computer and your player.
	<li>Make sure that your ethernet hub or switch supports 10Mbps connections (most do, but some do not).
	<li>Also try a different cable.
	<li>Try to use your systems &quot;ping&quot; utility to try to connect to your player.  If you get a message claiming 100 percent packet loss, there could be a network problem or misconfiguration.
	<li>Ensure that your player has an IP address on the same subnet as the server.  This usually means that the first 3 numbers of their IP addresses have the same values.
	<li>If using a wired player and there is a long run of ethernet cable in use, ensure that it is terminated with <a href="http://www.duxcw.com/digest/Howto/network/cable/cable5.htm">EIA/TIA 568A standard termination</a>.

<h5><a id="troubleshooting-upgrading"></a>I'm having trouble upgrading the firmware on my SLIMP3 Player. Do you have any hints?</h5>

<p>Try following these steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Plug the SLIMP3 device and the computer with the updater into the same hub or switch. (Do not attempt to upgrade your firmware over a wireless network.) Power the hub or switch off and then back on.
	<li>Remove the power connector from the back of the SLIMP3 device.
	<li>Stop the SlimServer software.
	<li>Run a browser and check that the SlimServer software has REALLY stopped.
	<li>Point the remote at the right side of the SLIMP3, hold down a numeric key, and reconnect the power plug to the SLIMP3. You should see the SLIMP3 display its MAC address. If not then unplug the DC power connector from the device, wait 30 seconds and t

ry this operation again. The SLIMP3 device MUST be displaying its MAC address before you can update the firmware. Write down the MAC address that the SLIMP3 is showing.
	<li>Start the updater application:
	<ul>
		<li>On Windows, the SLIMP3 Updater is in Program Files\SlimServer\firmware.   
		<li>Mac users can find the SLIMP3 Updater application in the Utilities folder of the SlimServer installer disk image.
		<li>On Linux, the firmware updater is /usr/local/bin/slimserver/slimp3/update_firmware.pl.
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>You will be prompted to enter the SLIMP3 MAC address in the form 00:04:20:xx:xx:xx - enter the exact same MAC address that the sliMP3 displayed in (5) at the updater prompt.
	<li>The updater will then ask for an IP address so enter the IP address that you have assigned to the SLIMP3 device or, if you have a DHCP server, then enter an address in the DHCP pool.
	<li>The updater may ask if you want to use &quot;Kiosk&quot; - you answer with &quot;y&quot; or &quot;N&quot;. Use &quot;N&quot; if you are having problems getting the SLIMP3 running - use the Kiosk mode once everything is working.
	<li>The updater will immediately start trying to update the SLIMP3 device at this point-this will take about 30 seconds.

<p>If the update succeeds and you find that the remote control does not work then you may have de-programmed the remote when you where holding down a key to get the SLIMP3 into boot mode. Try resetting remote.</p>

<p>If the updater fails to write to the SLIMP3 device then there is some sort of communications error. Check the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Is the SLIMP3 in &quot;firmware update&quot; mode?
	<li>Are you certain that the SlimServer software has stopped?
	<li>Could there be another copy of the SlimServer software running?
	<li>Did you enter the correct MAC address?
	<li>Is it really the correct MAC address?
	<li>Did you enter the correct IP address?
	<li>Is it really the correct IP address?
	<li>Can you ping the SLIMP3 device?
	<li>Check that you CANNOT ping the SLIMP3 device when you have disconnected it from the network to make sure that some other device isn't using that IP address.
</ul>

<h5><a id="troubleshooting-autoupdate"></a>The SlimServer software seems to be connecting to a website on its own every time I run the software.  What's going on?</h5>

<p>The SlimServer software connects to the server update.slimdevices.com every time it starts up and every 24 hours after that to check for updates. You can disable this feature in the Additional Server Settings area of the SlimServer.</p>

<h5><a id="troubleshooting-annoyingclick"></a>When the SlimServer software pages reload I hear an annoying click.  How do I get rid of it?</h5>

<p>This is a "feature" of Internet Explorer on Windows. To turn off the annoying "click" when exploring/ clicking on hyperlinks, navigate to <i>Start Menu / Settings / Sounds and Multimedia / Sounds</i>.  Look for the sound settings: <i>Windows Explorer / Start Navigation</i> and change the selected sound to "none".</p>

<h5><a id="troubleshooting-logfile"></a>Where does the system write it's logfile and how do I control this?</h5>

<p>On all systems, the lastest log entries can be seen on <a href="/log.txt">http://serverip:9000/log.txt</a>.</p>

<p>Log entries can also be written to a file which can specified using the --logfile command line option.</p> 

<p>Under Linux if using the standard init.d script the default path for log files is /tmp/slimserver.log . The path is controlled by the "SLIMSERVER_LOG" entry in the /etc/sysconfig/slimserver file. </p>

<h5><a id="troubleshooting-anothercopy"></a>On Windows XP, Slim Server hangs on startup, and sometimes the debug window says there is another copy running, how do I fix this?</h5>
<p>This seems to happen on Windows XP when the IP stack is keeping erroneous information or just not functioning properly.  Microsoft has published a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;299357">knowledge base article</a> about

 it.  
But the short of it is that you need to run one command to reset the stack.  To do this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Click Start
	<li>Click Run
	<li>Type in &quot;cmd&quot; and hit enter
	<li>In the DOS window, type in &quot;netsh int ip reset c:\resetlog.txt&quot; and hit enter.
	<li>Try to start Slim Server again
</ol>

<h5><a id="troubleshooting-lowsamplerate"></a><b>Original Squeezebox only:</b> I have some audio files or radio stations that do not play when using the digital outputs on my Squeezebox, but do with the analog.  Why?</h5>
<p>What you should probably check is the sampling rate of the audio file or stream in question.  If it's lower than 44.1kHz, that could explain why it's not working with the digital output.
S/P-DIF, the signal sent over the optical and coaxial digital outputs, supports sampling rates of 44.1kHz and 48kHz.</p>
<p>Some receivers may auto-sense whether a digital or analog signal is in use, as well.  If your receiver supports digital and analog connections for the input you are using, you may
want to connect both.  That way, when an audio signal that is not compatible with S/PDIF is sent to the Squeezebox is sent, your receiver may automatically switch to the analog input.</p>

<h5><a id="troubleshooting-permissions"></a>On Linux/UNIX, my player flashes rapidly through song titles but does not play them.</h5>
<p>Your file permissions may not be allowing SlimServer to read the audio files properly.  SlimServer runs under the user &quot;slimserver&quot; on Linux. Make sure that your music files have their permissions set so that the &quot;slimserver&quot; user can read the files in your music library.

<h5><a id="troubleshooting-tzwin"></a>On Windows using ActiveState Perl, the time on my players is displayed wrong during daylight savings.  Why?</h5>
<p>If the environment variable &quot;TZ&quot; is set to anything but a null value, Perl may report the time incorrectly.  Unsetting that environment variable in the script you're using to run SlimServer
should help.</p></div>
