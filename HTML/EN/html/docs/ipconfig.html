<p>
Setting up the Squeezebox for your network is much the same as setting up a computer on a network.
 You will need to know the following information:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Does your network support DHCP? If so, then there is no configuration
necessary. The Squeezebox will automatically obtain its IP address and locate
your server PC on the network.
<li>If your network does not have DHCP, then you will need to configure
the player using static IP addresses. You will need know the IP address of
your computer, and you will need one available IP address to assign to the
Squeezebox.
</ul>

<h4>The setup menu</h4>

<p> When the Squeezebox is first powered up, it will ask you if you want to
change the network settings. </p>

<p>
Use the up and down buttons to select an option. You can choose either to
go to the setup menu, or to skip setup and use the previous
settings. Press down once to choose &quot;Yes, go to setup menu&quot;, and
then press right.</p>

<p>There are three choices here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Completely automatic</b> - This is the easiest choice for most
networks. The Squeezebox will obtain its IP address
using DHCP and will locate the server automatically using Slim Discovery
Protocol. 
  <li><b>Specify server manually</b> - DHCP will be used, but the server's
IP address will be entered manually. Use this  if your server is not on
the same
LAN as the player. See the next document, Advanced Networking, for more
information
about this option.
  <li><b>Enter everything manually</b> - Static IPs will be used for
everything. Choose this option if your network does not support DHCP.
</ul>

<h4>Using DHCP</h4>

<p>
To use DHCP, simply choose "Completely automatic", then press right. The
player will ask you to confirm your choice. Press right again to
acknowledge. That's it. The player will take a second or two to locate
your DHCP server, and then you will be connected.
</p>

<h4>Using static IP address</h4>

<p>
To configure the player using static IP addresses, choose "Enter
everything manually".  This will take you to a series of four screens,
where you can enter the IP address of the player, your netmask, your
router's address, and the IP address of your server. To enter the
addresses, use the left and right buttons to select the digit to edit, and
up/down to change that digit. Press &quot;ok&quot; to go the next screen
(the 'ok' button is just below and to the right of the arrow buttons).
</p>

<p>When you've finished entering all off the addresses, you will see the 
following message. At this point, you can either press left to bo back and
review your changes, or press right to save the changes and exit the setup
menu.</p>
