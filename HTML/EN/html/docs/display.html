<h4>Display Hash</h4>

<p>As of 6.2, the preferred method to define the display for a player's
screen is via a display hash.  All display functions have
been updated to support the hash based api.</p>

<p>The standard 2 line display with 2 overlays is described as:</p>

<pre>my $hash = {
   'line1'    => 'Text to appear on top line',
   'line2'    => 'Text to appear on bottom line and possibly scroll',
   'overlay1' => 'Overlay to appear at right of top line',
   'overlay2' => 'Overlay to appear at right of bottom line',
}</pre>

<p>Centered text is described as:</p>

<pre>my $hash = {
   'center1' => 'Text to be centered on top line',
   'center2' => 'Text to be centered on bottom line',
}</pre>

<p>Symbols are typically displayed in one of the overlays but can exist in
any component.  Individual symbols can be added to the hash using
$client->symbols():</p>

<pre>my $hash = {
   'line1'    => 'Text to appear on top line',
   'line2'    => 'Text to appear on bottom line and possibly scroll',
   'overlay1' => $client->symbols('notesymbol'),
}</pre>

<p>See $client->symbols() below for valid symbol names.</p>

<h5>Player Specifics</h5>

<p>All player types (Slimp3/Squeezebox/Squeezebox-Graphics/Squeezebox2)
are intended to display in as similar way as possible.  However there
are some specifics due to the limited screen resolution of some hardware:</p>

<p><b>Text Displays (Slimp3/Squeezebox):</b></p>

<p>In two line mode overlays are displayed.  If center1/2 exists for a
line then this takes precedence over line1/2 such that only the
centered text and overlay are displayed.</p>

<p>Overlays truncate line1/2 so that the overlay is always displayed.
In the case of line1, text is simply truncated so the overlay fits.
In the case of line2, text will potentially scroll within the region of
the screen to the left of overlay2.  Centered text will also be
truncated by overlays if they appear in the same position.</p>

<p>In single line mode overlays are not displayed by default.  Again
centered text takes precedence such that if center2 exists then line2
will not be displayed.</p>

<p><b>Graphic Displays (Squeezebox-Graphics, Squeezebox2):</b></p>

<p>Graphics players attempt to display all components at the same time, so
that both center1/2 and line1/2 are displayed.  Overlay1/2 truncate
line1/2 in the same way as for text players.  However centered text is not
truncated by the overlays.  As the resulting bitmaps for each text
component are displayed on top of each other, it is the calling
function's responsibility to avoid overlapping text - e.g. by centered
text overlapping overlays.</p>

<h5>Bitmaps</h5>

<p>Graphics players may also display a bitmap:</p>

<pre>my $hash = {
   'bits' => $bitmap,
}</pre> 

<p>Where $bitmap is a byte string which defines a bitmap of appropriate
size for the display. The bitmap will be displayed on top of any other
text defined in the same display hash.</p>

<p>Squeezebox 1 G takes a 280 x 2 byte bitmap, with the first byte defining
the top 8 bits of the left most display column the second byte defining
the lower 8 bits. The 3rd & 4th byte describe the second column etc.</p>

<p>Squeezebox 2 takes a 320 x 4 byte bitmap, with the first byte defining
the top 8 bits of the first column, the next 3 defining the rest of
the first column etc.</p>

<h5>Fonts</h5>

<p>The display hash can define a font element to define the font to be
used for a display.  If it exists it takes precedence over the current
font for the player.</p>

<p>A simple font element is used to define a single font to use for all
components of the display:</p>

<pre>my $hash = {
   'line1' => 'Text to appear on top line',
   'line2' => 'Text to appear on bottom line and possibly scroll',
   'fonts' => {
       'graphic-320x32' => 'standard',
       'graphic-280x16' => 'small',
       'text'           => 2,
       }
}</pre>

<p>As different player use different fonts, it is normal to define the
font for each type of player:</p>

<ul>
	<li>'graphic-320x32' is the font used for Squeezebox2
	<li>'graphic-280x16' is the font used for Squeezebox1-Graphics
	<li>'text' defines the number of lines to display on
	Slimp3/Squeezebox1
</ul>

<p>The font element may also take a more detailed definition to allow
more complex displays to be defined.</p>

<p>For graphics players, the specific font for each of
line1/line2/overlay1/overlay2/center1/center2 can defined.  If the
font for only some components are defined, other components take the
current active font for the player.</p>

<p>The following fixes the font for overlay1, but leaves all other fonts
as the currently active player font:</p>

<pre>my $hash = {
   'fonts' => { 
       'graphic-280x16'  => { 'overlay1' => \ 'small.1' },
       'graphic-320x32'  => { 'overlay1' => \ 'standard.1' },
       }
}</pre>

<p>Note: the font name should be the font file name including the line
number.  It is specified as a reference to a string. [This is used to
speed up the font rendering code]</pre>

<p>By setting non standard fonts for each component it is possible to
create new types of display.  For example using 'standard.1' for line2
and 'standard.2' for line1 means that the top line of the display can
be made to scroll.  [Only line2 scrolls, but by changing the font it
appears on a different portion of the screen.]  Care should be taken
in setting the overlay fonts to match as the point at which line1 &
line2 are truncated is based on the respective overlays.</p>

<p>For text players, the font element may define the number of lines and
also force display of overlays in single line mode:</p>

<pre>my $hash = {
   'fonts' => { 
       'text'  => { 'lines' => 1,
                    'displayoverlays' => 1
		  },
       }
}</pre>

<ul>
	<li>'lines' defines whether 1 line (doubled) or 2 line mode should be used.
	<li>'displayoverlays' set to 1 forces overlays to be displayed in two line,
mode.
</ul>

<h5>Scrolling</h5>

<p>For all players, text in line2 will scroll if it is too long to fit
into the space to the left of overlay2.  The default operation of
scrolling for a player is set via preference 'scrollMode', but can be
overridden by setting 'scrollmode' in the display hash:</p>

<pre>my $hash = {
   'scrollmode' => < 'scrollonce' | 'noscroll' | 'ticker' >
}</pre>

<p>Where 'scrollonce' means line2 will scroll round once but then stop
scrolling until it changes.  'noscroll' indicates that line2 should
not scroll.  'ticker' is a special scroll mode which is described below.</p>

<p>Normal scrolling of line2 shows as much of line2 as will fit to the
left of overlay2.  This is displayed without scrolling for the
'scrollPause' interval.  Line2 then rotates to the left to the point
when the start of line2 is displayed again.  At this point the display
pauses again before continuing the rotation.</p>

<p>During scrolling, if update is called with a display hash which
changes line1, overlay1 or overlay2 these are updated without
interrupting scrolling.  This allows scrolling to continue while
elapsed times etc are updated, for example in the Now Playing screen.</p>

<h5>Ticker Scrolling</h5>

<p>Ticker scrolling is designed to be used by screensavers such as the
RssNews.  It changes the scrolling operation to that of a ticker
display - text appears from the right edge, scrolls across the screen
and off the left side.  It does not rotate in the manner of normal
scrolling.</p>

<p>Ticker scrolling is activated by setting the 'scrollmode' to 'ticker'
in the display hash and is cleared as soon as a display hash without
this is sent to update.</p>

<p>Items are added to the ticker by calling update with a display hash
such as:</p>

<pre>my $hash = {
   'line1' => 'Non scrolling top line',
   'line2' => 'New item to be added to ticker',
   'scrollmode => 'ticker',
}</pre>

<p>If line1/overlay1/overlay2 changes during ticker mode these are
displayed immediately.  However if anything is defined for line2, this
is added to the ticker queue and will appear once items currently in
the ticker queue have been displayed.</p>

<p>The function: $client->scrollTickerTimeLeft() is used to find the
current length of the ticker queue and is used to optimise when new
items are added to the queue:</p>

<pre>my ($complete, $queue) = $client->scrollTickerTimeLeft();</pre>

<p>Where $complete is the approx number of seconds left before all text
disappears off the left hand side of the display.  $queue is the
approx number of seconds worth of text which is queued up but has not
yet appeared on the right edge of the display.</p>

<p>A lines function may use this to decide whether to return undef or
text for line2.  If undef is returned for line2, nothing is added to
the ticker queue allowing it to drain.</p>

<p>For example to maintain a ticker using a lines function which is
called once per second:</p>

<pre>sub lines {
   my $client = shift;
   my ($complete, $queue) = $client->scrollTickerTimeLeft();
   
   my $text = 'Whatever you want to add to the ticker';

   return( {
      'line1' => 'Fixed top line',
      'line2' => ($queue < 1) ? $text : undef,
      'scrollmode' => 'ticker',
   });
}</pre>

<hr>
<h4>Display Functions</h4>

<p>Displays are sent to the screen via one of the display functions:</p>

<h5>$client->update()</h5>

<p>This is the normal way of updating the display.  Updated is normally
called with no params and in this case the lines function registered
for the current mode is called to determine the display hash.</p>

<p>Update can be called with a display hash to display something other
than the current lines immediately:</p>

<pre>$client->update( {
   'line1' => 'line1 display',
   'line2' => 'line2 display',
}</pre>

<p>However as the server may call $client->update() to refresh the
display this is not recommended.  It is normal to use the lines
function to return the display and call $client->update() to use it.</p>

<p>If a plugin wishes to update the display on a regular basis, this is
best done by setting the following in the setMode function:</p>
<pre>$client->param('modeUpdateInterval', X);</pre>

<p>Where X defines the number of seconds between each update.  The server
will automatically call update every X seconds whilst in this mode.</p>

<h5>$client->showBriefly()</h5>

<p>This is used to display a message on the screen for a short
period of time, before returning to the normal display of the mode.</p>

<p>showBriefly should always be called with a display hash and one or more
optional parameters:</p>

<pre>$client->showBriefly($hash, $duration, $firstline, $blockupdate)</pre>
<ul>
	<li>$hash - the display hash
	<li>$duration - number of seconds to display for (defaults to 1)
	<li>$firstline - display only line1 if in single line mode (otherwise displays line2 in single line mode)
	<li>$block - block display so that calls to update during
$duration do not cancel the showBriefly display (defaults to false)
</ul>

<p>For example:</pre>

<pre>$client->showBriefly( {
   'line1' => $line1,
   'line2' => $line2,
   'overlay2' => $client->symbols('notesymbol'),
}, 5, undef, 1);</pre>

<p>Displays two lines plus an overlay for 5 seconds and is not cancelled by
updates during this time.</p>

<p>[showBriefly also accepts the old $line1, $line2 in place of the
display hash for backwards compatibility.  Note however that as
showBriefly now takes a display hash, there is no need to use
$client->renderOverlay() to build a display to send to showBriefly]</p>

<h5>$client->block()</h5>

<p>This is used to display a message for a period of time with a spinning
activity notification in overlay1.  The message is displayed using the
'block' mode so that it is not interrupted and is only cleared by a
call to $client->upblock().</p>

<pre>$client->block($hash)</pre>

<ul><li>$hash - display hash</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>$client->block( {
   'line1' => string('PLAYER_NEEDS_UPGRADE_1'), 
   'line2' => string('PLAYER_NEEDS_UPGRADE_2'),
   'fonts' => { 
      'graphic-320x32' => 'standard',
      'graphic-280x16' => 'small',
      'text'           => 2,
      }
});</pre>

<p>This forces the font so that two lines are displayed and displays two strings
until $client->unblock() is called.</p>

<p>[block also takes $line1, $line2 for backwards compatibility]<p>

<h5>Lines</h5>

<p>A mode's lines function should return the display hash to display when
$client->update() is called.</p>

<p>A simple lines function would be:</p>

<pre>sub lines {
    my $client = shift;

    return {
       'line1'    => 'Line1 text',
       'line2'    => 'Line2 text',
       'overlay1' => $client->symbols('notesymbol'),
    };
}</pre>

<p>A more complex lines function which specifies the fonts and scrolling
mode would be:</p>

<pre>sub lines {
    my $client = shift;

    return {
       'line1'      => 'Line1 text',
       'line2'      => 'Line2 text',
       'overlay1'   => $client->symbols('bell'),
       'scrollmode' => 'scrollonce',
       'fonts'      => { 
           'graphic-280x16'  => { 'overlay1' => \ 'small.1' },
           'graphic-320x32'  => { 'overlay1' => \ 'standard.1' },
           'text' =>            { 'lines' => 2,
                                  'displayoverlays' => 1,
                                  },
           },
    };
}</pre>

<p>Note: A lines function which returns a display hash is responsible
for converting symbol names to symbol characters.  The lines function
should therefore call $client->symbols() on any text which contains
symbols prior to adding to the display hash.</p>

<h5>$client->symbols()</h5>

<p>$client->symbols() is used to convert the names of symbols to the
graphic character representing the symbol itself.  As of 6.2 the
preferred use of $client->symbols() is as a replacement for
Slim::Display::Display:symbol to specify individual symbols.  However
it can also be used to parse a complete text line and convert symbol
tokens (created by Slim::Display::Display::symbol) into the symbol
character.</p>

<p>Preferred use:</p>

<pre>return {
   'line1'    => 'text '.$client->symbols('bell').' more text',
   'overlay2' => $client->symbols('bell'),
}</pre>

<p>Valid symbol names are currently:
<ul>
	<li>'notesymbol'
	<li>'rightarrow'
	<li>'cursor'
	<li>'mixable'
	<li>'bell'
	<li>'progress1'
	<li>'progress2'
	<li>'progress3'
	<li>'progress1e'
	<li>'progress2e'
	<li>'progress3e'
	<li>'progressEnd'
</ul>

<h5>$client->curLines()</h5>

<p>$client->curLines() returns a display hash using the current lines
function.  This is equivalent to the display that would result from
calling $client->update().<p>

<p>The method returns the same information as
Slim::Display::Display::curLines(), but always returns a display hash
even if the lines function itself does not return a display hash.</p>

<h5>$client->curDisplay()</h5>

<p>$client->curDisplay() returns a display hash containing the text
components of the current display.  [It contains each of line1, line2,
overlay1, overlay2, center1, center2 but does not contain font or
scrolling elements.]</p>

<p>The difference between $client->curDisplay() and $client->curLines()
is that $client->curLines() makes a call to the mode's lines function
and hence potentially gets a new display, whereas
$client->curDisplay() returns what is currently being displayed.</p>

<hr>
<h4>Menu Transitions</h4>

<p>The client methods used for menu transitions also take display hashes
to define the start and end screens.</p>

<p>e.g. $client->pushLeft($starthash, $endhash);</p>
<p></p>
<p>more to come...</p>
