<p>
The SqueezeCenter can display artwork associated with each album.
This "cover art" is typically a copy of the CD/album's cover.
</p>
<p>
Artwork is displayed in several places within the SqueezeCenter Web interface.
The details of the display vary depending on the skin currently being
used. The "Default", "Fishbone," and "Moser" skins have browse by cover art 
functions, clicking on a picture of the CD/album will select the album for
playing or processing. The "Fishbone" skin also displays the cover art
in the status display as the songs are played.
</P>

<h4>What is Artwork, how does the SqueezeCenter use it?</h4>
<p>
Artwork is cover art from CD albums. It is displayed both to beautify 
the SqueezeCenter interface, and in the "Browse by artwork" section to
specify which albums are selected for playing or processing.
</p>

<h4>How do I get cover art?</h4>
<p>
Many site that sell CDs include
cover art in their catalog. With most browsers, you can right click
on the image and select "Save image as..."
</P>
<p>
Several third party developers have written utilities
to automatically retreive cover art based on the internal tags 
of your MP3, Ogg, Flac, or other files. See 
<a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/dev_third_party.html">http://www.slimdevices.com/dev_third_party.html</a> 
for more information.
</p>
<h4>Graphic file requirements</h4>
The SqueezeCenter will display any graphic file that your browser can support. 
Nearly all browsers support .GIF and .JPG files, so most SlimDevices
customers use one of these file formats.
<h4>Image sizes</h4>
<p>
The image files should be modest in size, as they are sized to fit
on the HTML browser window. There is no reason to have images
larger than 300x300 pixels, they won't be displayed with that size,
and it simply takes up space and bandwidth.
</P>
<p>
There are two file sizes in use in the current skins.
One image is used when you select tracks from an  album, the image
size should be about 300x300 pixels. A second image is 
used as a "thumbnail" in the browse-by-coverart, and is displayed
in the status pane of the Fishbone skin. This image should be
no larger than 100x100.

<h4>Technical details</h4>
For each place in the skin that references a large cover art image,
the SqueezeCenter software performs the following search:
<ul>
<li>Search in the current music directory for (in order): <br>
<ol><li>cover.jpg, cover.gif, <li>folder.jpg, folder.gif, <li>album.jpg, album.gif, <li>thumb.jpg, thumb.gif, <li>albumartsmall.jpg, albumartsmall.gif</ul>
</ol>
<p>
The SqueezeCenter will use the first image file located in this search.
For the smaller, thumbnail image, a similar search is performed, except that
the list is reversed, searching for thumb first. 
Specifically:
<ul>
<li>Search in the current music directory for (in order):<br>
<ol><li>thumb.jpg, thumb.gif, <li>albumartsmall.jpg, albumartsmall.gif, <li>cover.jpg, cover.gif, <li>album.jpg, album.gif, <li>folder.jpg, folder.gif</ol>
</ul>

<p>
SqueezeCenter looks in the same path as the song, thus you would be looking for the
same artfile in this case.  However there is an option in Server Settings,
Additional, Interface for setting filenames for Artwork, Artwork Thumbnail, and
for setting a central location for artwork files. You can enter a specific filename 
if you use something not found in the list (eg, artwork.jpg).  You may also create 
filenames based on song variables.  If your first character is %, the server then parses
 the rest of the string as an InfoFormat, the same as title format is created.
</p>

<p>
As an example, you could create a single directory of songs and name all your
artwork as artist-album.jpg.  For this, enter a setting of 
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;%ARTIST-ALBUM.jpg</pre> for
Artwork or Artwork Thumbnail in the server settings section.  The extension can be specified for any SqueezeCenter supported format, .jpg is
assumed if no extension is given.

Elements can be separated by anything (or nothing). The separators are only used
if the data elements are present.
</p>

<p>
The above list is included for completeness, it is unlikely that anyone would actually
want to have differing artwork files for songs of different bitrates, but the
ability is in the SqueezeCenter.
</P>

<p>
Artwork internal to the  ID3 tags within a song takes precedence, followed by any specified filename in the server
settings.  If an Artwork Folder setting is used (in Server Settings, Additional, Interface) then that folder is searched first
for any file matching those given for Artwork and Artwork Thumbnail.

In the Thumbnail selection, the Server reverses the search list so that thumb is found before cover. This
way, you can have a set of large images and a set of small ones.  

<p>
Browse by artwork and status BOTH scale the same image
file found for Thumb.  By default, the browse by artwork contrains to 100x100,
while the status contrains to 100 leaving aspect ratio intact. 
</p>

<h4>Memory usage for Artwork</h4>
<p>
Artwork for large song libraries places a significant
memory load on the SqueezeCenter. There are references to
the cover art kept in memory of the SqueezeCenter for each song.
This can add up fairly quickly. 
</p>

<p>
The SqueezeCenter stores, in memory, the path where the artwork can be found for each
song. Long path names and many songs can cause the SqueezeCenter
to use more memory than is phycially installed on the server. This can
have any of a number of impacts, from slow performance to complete
failure of the SqueezeCenter to run.
 The raw
artwork file is read on demand, so
artwork file size has no impact on the SqueezeCenter itself.
</p>

<p>
You can
turn off the artwork scan completely to save memory usage.  Its in Server
Settings, additional, performance.
