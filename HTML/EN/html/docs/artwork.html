<h4>What is Artwork?</h4>
 <p>Artwork is cover art from CD albums and typically a copy of the CD/album's cover.
 The Logitech Media Server can display artwork associated with each album.
 </p>

<h4>How does the Squeezebox software use it?</h4> 
 <p>Artwork is displayed in several places within the Squeezebox software.
  When you import (scan) your library - the scanner uses the first picture for all other media files found in that Folder.
  So you should use one Folder for each Album.
 </p>
<h4>Where should i store the cover art?</h4>
 <ul>
  <ol>
   <li>You can embed the cover art into your media files by using your favourite mp3/flac tagging tool.
   <p>If embedded artwork is used - these pictures will always be the first used by the Software.     
   <li>You can store the artwork into the Folderstructure of your Library.
    <p>Logitech Media Server looks in the same path as the song, thus you would be looking for the same artfile in this case.</p>
   <li>You can store them into a separte Folder for your cover art.
    <p>There is an option in Server Settings, Advanced, Formatting for setting filenames for Artwork, Artwork
    Thumbnail, and for setting a central location for artwork files. You can enter a specific filename if you use something not found in the list (eg, artwork.jpg).
    You may also create filenames based on song variables.  For furter
    information scroll down to <b>Filenames based on song variables</b>
   </p> 
  </ol>
 </ul>
  
<h4>How do I get cover art?</h4>
<p>Many site that sell CDs include cover art in their catalog. With most browsers, you can right click on the image and select "Save image as..."</p>
<h4>Useful plugins</h4>
<p>Several third party developers have written utilities to automatically retreive cover art based on the internal tags of your MP3, Ogg, Flac, or other files. See 
<a href="http://forums.slimdevices.com/forumdisplay.php?4-3rd-Party-Software" target="_new" class="browseItemLink"
>3rd-Party-Software</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>Find albums with small /missing artwork used in your library:</h4>
 <p>The Music Artist Info Plugin can support you to find albums with no or small artwork.
    If you enabled this plugin before a scan/rescan - it supports you with some additional Information under the extras in the main menue.
 </p>
 
<h4>Graphic file requirements</h4>
<p>The Squeezebox will display any graphic file that your browser can support. 
Nearly all browsers support .GIF .PNG and .JPG files, so most customers use one of these file formats.</p>

<h4>Image sizes</h4>
 <p>The image files should be modest in size, as they are sized to fit on the HTML browser window. 
 There is no reason to have images with a larger Resolution than 72 or 96 dpi,
 as these High-Res images are made for printing and it simply takes up space and bandwidth
 and slows down the usability of the server.</p>

<h4>Technical details</h4>
 <p>For each place in the skin that references a large cover art image, the Squeezebox software performs the following search:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Search in the current music directory for (in order): <br>
  <ol>
   <li>cover.jpg, cover.gif,
   <li>folder.jpg, folder.gif,
   <li>album.jpg, album.gif,
   <li>thumb.jpg, thumb.gif, 
   <li>albumartsmall.jpg, albumartsmall.gif
  </ol>
</ul>
 <p>The Logitech Media Server will use the first image file located in this search.</p>
<h4>Filenames based on song variables</h4>
 <p>If your first character is %, the server then parses the rest of the string as an InfoFormat, the same as title format is created. As an example, you could create a single directory of songs and name all your artwork as artist-album.jpg.  For this, enter a setting of</p> 
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;%ARTIST-ALBUM.jpg</pre> 
 <p>for Artwork or Artwork Thumbnail in the server settings section.</p>
 <p> The extension can be specified for any Logitech Media Server supported format, .jpg is assumed if no extension is given.</p>

<p>Elements can be separated by anything (or nothing). The separators are only used if the data elements are present.</p>

<p>The above list is included for completeness, it is unlikely that anyone would actually want to have differing artwork files for songs of different bitrates, but the
ability is in the Logitech Media Server.
</P>

<p>Artwork internal to the  ID3 tags within a song takes precedence, followed by any specified filename in the server
settings.  If an Artwork Folder setting is used (in Server Settings, Additional, Interface) then that folder is searched first
for any file matching those given for Artwork.
</p>

<p>Browse by artwork and status BOTH scale the same image file found for Thumb.  By default, the browse by artwork contrains to 100x100,
while the status constrains to 100 leaving aspect ratio intact.
