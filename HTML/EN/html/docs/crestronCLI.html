[SET title SLIMP3 Command Line Interface]
[SET techinfo 1]
[INCLUDE helpheader.html]

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The SLIMP3 server provides a command-line interface to the SLIMP3 players via standard in and out and
  a TCP/IP port.  After starting the server, commands may be sent by connecting to a specific TCP/IP 
  port or directly from the command line.  Each command is terminated by a carriage return. The server will 
  reply echoing the request. If the request included a &quot;?&quot; in a parameter 
  to request a value from the server, the &quot;?&quot; will be replaced by the 
  requested value in the reply.  By default, the SLIMP3 server will listen for 
  connections on TCP/IP port 9090. This format is designed for ease of integration 
  into Crestron and other automation systems.</p>
<p>The format of the commands is as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>[&lt;<em>playerid</em>&gt;] &lt;<em>p0</em>&gt; &lt;<em>p1</em>&gt; 
    &lt;<em>p2</em>&gt; &lt;<em>p3</em>&gt; &lt;<em>p4</em>&gt; &lt;<em>CR</em>&gt;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
where: </p> 
<blockquote> 
  <p> <strong>&lt;<em>playerid</em>&gt;</strong> is the unique identifier for the player, usually (but not guaranteed to be) the IP address or MAC address of the player. The <strong>&lt;<em>playerid</em>&gt;</strong> 
    may be omitted if there is only one player in the system or when using the 
    &quot;player&quot; commands.</p>
  <p> <strong>&lt;<em>playerid</em>&gt;</strong> may be obtained by using the 
    &quot;player address&quot; command.</p>
  <p> <strong>&lt;<em>p0</em>&gt;</strong> through <strong>&lt;<em>p4</em>&gt;</strong> 
    are command parameters. Pass a &quot;?&quot; to obtain a value for that parameter
     in the response. Each parameter  needs to be encoded
    using percent-style escaping the same method as is used in URLs. (For example,
    &quot;The Clash?&quot; would be encoded as &quot;The%20Clash%3F&quot;.)</p>
			<p><b>Note: </b>Commands that use paths to songs or playlists can use relative paths from the root of the Music Library folder to specify songs.  For example, if the Music Library is specified as &quot;D:\mymusic&quot; and you'd like to refer to a song in that folder named &quot;foo.mp3&quot;  you can specify just &quot;foo.mp3&quot; in the command parameter.  Likewise, to refer to items in the Saved Playlist folder, you can use a prefix of  &quot;__playlists/&quot; before the path.  For example, to refer to the saved playlist &quot;bar.m3u&quot; in the Saved Playlists folder, you can specify a path of &quot;__playlists/bar.m3u&quot;.</p>

<h4>Supported Commands</h4>
<p>The following commands are supported:</p>
<p><strong>player count ?<br>
  </strong><strong>player name &lt;<em>playerindex</em>&gt; ?<br>
  </strong><strong>player address &lt;<em>playerindex</em>&gt; ?</strong></p>
<p>To obtain information about the players in the system, use the &quot;player 
  count&quot;, &quot;player name&quot; and &quot;player address&quot; commands. 
  The &quot;player count&quot; command returns the number of players in the system. 
  The &quot;player name&quot; command returns the human-readable name for the 
  specified player. The &quot;player address&quot; command returns the player's 
  IP address and port. This value is used when specifying a player in subsequent 
  commands. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Request: &quot;player count ?&lt;CR&gt;&quot;<br>
    Response: &quot;player count 2&lt;CR&gt;&quot;</p>
  <p> Request: &quot;player name 0 ?&lt;CR&gt;&quot;<br>
    Response: &quot;player name 0 Living Room&lt;CR&gt;&quot;</p>
  <p> Request: &quot;player address 0 ?&lt;CR&gt;&quot;<br>Response: &quot;player address 0 04:20:00:12:23:45&lt;CR&gt;&quot;</p>

  jump to a particular position in a song by specifying a number of seconds to 
  seek to . You may also jump to a relative position within a song by putting 
  an explicit &quot;-&quot; or &quot;+&quot; character before a number of second 
  you would like to seek.</p>
