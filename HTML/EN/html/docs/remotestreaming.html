<p>The SlimServer was designed to stream mp3 files to a Squeezebox Network Music Player.  However, it can also steam the same files over the Internet to MP3 software player such as Winamp and iTunes.

<p>For the sake of discussion, the computer running the SlimServer will be called the remote machine.

<p>First install and start the SlimServer software on this machine.
Make sure it is reachable over the Internet.  If not, you will need to open 9000 port on your router.

<p>Now, use the following instructions:
<ol>
<li>Open the stream called http://localhost:9000/stream.mp3 in your MP3 software player.  (Replace "localhost" with the IP address of the remote computer). This will inform the SlimServer that the software player is ready to receive a stream.

<li>Open the web interface of the SlimServer running on the remote computer by opening the web page http://localhost:9000 (Replace "localhost" with the IP address of the remote computer). You will notice a "player" corresponding to the IP address of the computer with the MP3 software player. 

<li>Use the left pane of the SlimServer web interface to browse and select files and playlists.  When music is selected, it will appear in the right pane of the web interface.

<li>Click on "Play" in the right pane of the SlimServer web interface to start the music. 

<li>After a couple of seconds, you will hear music playing through the MP3 software player. (The delay is due to buffering in the MP3 player software.) 

<li>To change the content playing, use the SlimServer on the remote machine.

<li>If you are using the SlimServer's password security, you'll need to use a slightly modified URL like this: http://username:password@localhost:9000/stream.mp3
</ol>
<p>Your music can also be streamed to a Squeezebox Network Music Player for listening on a stereo.  For more information about this product and FAQs, visit <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/">www.slimdevices.com</a>.
