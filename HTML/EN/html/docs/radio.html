      <p>To listen to an Internet Radio station, choose one of the
      options listed below:</p>

      <h3>Tune In Now</h3>
      <p>If you already know the URL of the station you would like to listen
      to, enter it below and click on the "Tune In" button. You can
      enter the URL of either the radio stream itself
      (e.g. http://62.49.59.50:8000) or the playlist file that is
      pointing to the stream
      (e.g. http://www.hitzradio.com/hitzradio.pls).</p>

      <form name="tune" method="get" action="[% webroot %]html/docs/radio.html">
          <input type="hidden" name="p0" value="playlist">
          <input type="hidden" name="p1" value="play">
          <input type="hidden" name="player" value="[% player %]">
          Radio URL: 
          <input type="text" class="stdedit" name="p2" size="50">
          <input type="submit" class="stdclick" value="Tune In" onclick='document.forms.tune.submit(); for (var i=0; i < parent.frames.length; i++) if (parent.frames[i].name == "status") parent.frames[i].location.reload(true);'>
      </form>


      <h3>Internet Radio Providers</h3>

      <p>SlimServer includes support for several Internet Radio
      providers, include Shoutcast, Live365 and radioio. To browse the
      station directories of these providers, navigate to the
      <code>Internet Radio</code> menu on your Squeezebox or Transporter.</p>

      <p>Some providers have premium subscription options. To enter
      your username and password for an Internet Radio provider, or
      configure how you view the provider's stations, click <a href="[% webroot %]setup.html?page=radio&player=[% player | uri %]">here</a>. You
      can also choose the <code>Internet Radio</code> section on the <code><a href="[% webroot %]setup.html?page=BASIC_SERVER_SETTINGS&player=[% player | uri %]">Server Settings</a></code>
      page.</p>

      <h3>Playlist Files</h3>

      <p>To save a pointer to an Internet Radio station that you
      listen to often, you can create an .m3u or .pls playlist file
      containing the URL of the station in your Saved Playlists
      folder.  You can download these files by right-clicking on the
      links at most streaming radio web sites.</p>

      <p>iTunes users can drag stations from the Radio section of
      iTunes to their Library or to a playlist. It will then be
      available in the Saved Playlists area in the corresponding
      iTunes section.</p>

      <p>You can also create playlists for Internet radio stations
          yourself using a text editor. They're just small text files
          containing the URLs of one or more stations.
	      
Here's an example .pls file from www.live365.com for a station called Monkeyfunk:</p>
      <pre>
[playlist]
numberofentries=1
File1=http://62.49.59.50:8000
Title1=Monkeyfunk
Length1=-1
Version=2
</pre>

 <p>The SlimServer can also create and use M3U playlist files. M3U
   playlist files simply contain a list of one or more URLs or path
   names, each on its own line in the file.</p>

 <p>One note: Internet radio stations often change their URL or go offline. If
   you are having problems with a station that worked at one time, visit their
   website again and see if you need to update your playlist file for that station.</p>
