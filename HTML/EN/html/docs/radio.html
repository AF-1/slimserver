      <p>The Squeezebox  supports  MP3 streaming protocols, including Shoutcast,
      Icecast, Live365, and HTTP. Other streaming formats which do not use MP3
encoding (Real and WMA for example) are not currently supported.</p>
      <p>To play
          an Internet Radio station, simply save an .m3u or .pls playlist file
          containing the URL of the station in your Saved Playlists folder.
        You can download these files by right-clicking on the links at most streaming
        radio
        web sites.</p>
      <p>iTunes users can drag stations from the Radio section of iTunes to their
      Library or to a playlist. It will then be available in the Saved
        Playlists area in the corresponding iTunes section.</p>
      <p>You
          can
          also
          create playlists for Internet radio stations yourself using a text
        editor. They're just small text files containing the URLs of one or more
        stations.
	      
Here's an example .pls file from www.live365.com for a station called Monkeyfunk:</p>
      <pre>
[playlist]
numberofentries=1
File1=http://62.49.59.50:8000
Title1=Monkeyfunk
Length1=-1
Version=2
</pre>

 <p>The SlimServer can
   also create and use M3U playlist files. M3U playlist files simply contain
   a list of one or more URLs or
   path
   names,
   each on
   its
   own line
   in
   the file.</p>
 <p>One note: Internet radio stations often change their URL or go offline. If
   you are having problems with a station that worked at one time, visit their
   website again and see if you need to update your playlist file for that station.</p>
