<h4>Squeezebox Graphics Font Files</h4>
<p>Font files reside in the Graphics folder</p>

<p>For each font set (one font for the top line of the display, 
another for the bottom) there's a separate BMP file.  For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>medium.1.font.bmp</b> - the font used at the top of the screen when in "medium" display mode
<li><b>medium.2.font.bmp</b> - the font used at the bottom of the screen when in "medium" display mode
</ul>

<p>(Single-line display modes, such as the Huge font, only require the bottom font file.)

<p>Open these files and you'll see a long horizontal line of characters.  

<p>The first 16 rows of pixels are the font bitmaps themselves.  

<p>The 17th row is used to mark the beginning and end of characters.  

<p>Each file has up to 256 characters using the latin1 character set, in order from 0 to 255.  

<p>The first 31 characters are reserved for use in special graphics characters:

<ul>
	<li>0 - Inter-character spacing
	<li>1 - Note symbol
	<li>2 - Right arrow
	<li>3 - Progress indicator end
	<li>4 - Progress indicator first column (empty)
	<li>5 - Progress indicator second column (empty)
	<li>6 - Progress indicator additional columns (empty)
	<li>7 - Progress indicator first column (full)
	<li>8 - Progress indicator second column (full)
	<li>9 - Progress indicator additional columns (full)
	<li>10 - Cursor overlay
	<li>11 - Moodlogic symbol
</ul>

<p>The 32nd character is a space character, and the rest follow the latin1 character set.

<p>We used photoshop to create the font files, saving them as 1bpp Windows BMP files.    

<p>For the time being, if you modify a font file, you'll need to restart SlimServer 
to see your changes.  Also, there's no user interface for selecting additional fonts, 
so you'll need to swap out one of the existing ones until we update the software 
to allow you to choose from the web interface.  (Which should only be a couple of days...)
