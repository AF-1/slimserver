<h4>Connecting Your Player</h4>

<ol>
<li>Connect your player to your stereo amplifier or receiver using an RCA cable to the red and white connectors. 
 	You can also connect a digital optical cable to the square connector or digital coaxial cable to the orange connector.  If you are using headphones or powered speakers with a Squeezebox, you can connect them to the 1/8" mini-jack. 
<li>If you are using a wired connection, plug an ethernet cable from your hub or switch to your player.
<li>Put the two AAA batteries into the remote control.
<li>Connect the power supply to your player and plug it in.
	You can leave your player plugged in at all times. When not in use, it enters standby mode and powers down the display. 
</ol>

<p>Note: Squeezebox comes with a regulated power adaptor. Do not use a different power supply; this may damage the player.

<h4>Configuring Your Player</h4>
<p>When you plug in your player, the Logitech logo is displayed briefly, followed by a welcome message.
Set Up Networking
<ol>
<li>Press the RIGHT arrow on the remote control. The Set Up Networking menu option is displayed.
<li>Press the RIGHT arrow to enter networking setup.
<li>If you have a wired-only Squeezebox, skip to step 8. Otherwise, choose whether you want to connect your player to a wireless or wired network by pressing the up and down arrows on the remote. When you have made your selection, press the RIGHT arrow.
<li>Your player asks you for your local region or country. Scroll using the down arrow on the remote until you find the local region. Press the right arrow to select your region.
Note: Failure to select the appropriate region may violate local laws.
<li>Your player will scan to find your wireless network.  Select your network name (SSID) and press the right arrow.
	If you are in an area where there are multiple wireless networks, you can scroll down using the remote until you find the one you want to use. If your router is not broadcasting your network name, you will need to select "Enter a network name". 
<p>Tip: You can use the number buttons on the remote to enter text as you might on a cell phone. Use the ADD button on the remote as a backspace and the PLAY button to insert a letter. 
<li>Choose the type of encryption your wireless network uses. If you are unsure, check the manual that came with your wireless router.
	You can choose from No password/no encryption, 64-bit WEP, 128-bit WEP, WPA Personal or WPA2 (AES). Scroll to your selection, then press the RIGHT arrow. 
<li>If your network is secured with WEP or WPA encryption, you'll need to enter the network password or key using the numbers and letters on the remote and press the right arrow. 
<p>Tip: WEP keys consist of a string of ten or twenty-six digits or letters A through F. WPA passwords are a string of letters, numbers or punctuation. 
	Your player connects to your wireless network. If your player does not connect to your wireless access point, visit our <a href="http://faq.slimdevices.com">FAQ</a> for troubleshooting information. 
<li>Choose whether you want your player to obtain an IP address automatically using DHCP, or whether you want to assign it a static IP address. Most networks will let your player obtain an address automatically. Press the right arrow. 
	If you chose to assign a static IP to the player, enter it using the numbers on the remote. Press the RIGHT arrow to save the address.
<p>Tip: Use leading zeroes to specify numbers with fewer than 3 digits, for example, you would enter 010.001.004.281 for 10.1.4.281. 
	Enter the subnet mask for the network, the default gateway IP address, and the address of your DNS server, pressing the right arrow on the remote to move to each one. 
</ol>

<h4>Connecting to SlimServer</h4>
<ol>
<li>If SlimServer isn't already running, start it now. 
	Your player will scan your local network to find the computer that's running SlimServer. If you started SlimServer after starting setup, you may need to scroll to find it. 
<li>Select the computer you want to use. If you are running SlimServer on multiple computers on your local network, you can use the down arrow to scroll to the one you want to use.
<li>Press the RIGHT arrow on the remote to connect.
</ol>

<p>Setup is complete.

<p>Tip: If you want to go back to setup later press the left arrow on the remote down and hold it for five seconds. Your display will return to the Set Up Networking menu.
