<h4>Hooking Up Your SLIMP3 Player</h4>
<p>Step 1: Connect your SLIMP3 player to your stereo</p>
<p> Connect one end of the included stereo RCA cables to the red and white connectors 
  on the back of the SLIMP3 player. Connect the other end to an available line 
  input on your stereo or powered speakers.</p>
<p>Step 2: Connect your SLIMP3 player to your network</p>
<p>Insert one end of the included ethernet cable to the rectangular connector 
  on the back of your SLIMP3 player. Connect the other end to your ethernet switch 
  or hub. (If you want to connect your SLIMP3 directly to the ethernet port on 
  your computer, you&#8217;ll likely need a &#8220;crossover&#8221; ethernet cable, 
  which should be available from your local computer retailer.)</p>
<p>Step 3: Plug in your SLIMP3 player</p>
<p>Insert the connector at the end of the thin power cable into the remaining 
  round hole on the back of the SLIMP3. Plug the AC power cord into the power 
  adaptor, and then plug the AC power cord into your AC outlet. Please be careful 
  to use only the power supply that came with your SLIMP3 player&#8212;connecting 
  a different power supply may damage the player, and such damage is not covered 
  under warranty.</p>
<p>The player can be left plugged in at all times. When not in use, it enters 
  a &#8220;standby&#8221; mode, powering down the display and drawing very little 
  power.</p>
<h4>Setting Up the SLIMP3 Remote Control</h4>
<p>If your SLIMP3 came with a custom remote for SLIMP3, just install the included batteries. If your SLIMP3 came with a Sony universal remote control, you&#8217;ll have to set it up. First, install 
  the included batteries in the remote, and then press the buttons on the remote 
  in this sequence:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>S, DVD, 0, 0, 7, ENT, DVD</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sequence tells the remote to use its DVD mode to control the SLIMP3 player. 
  If you&#8217;d also like the remote to control the SLIMP3&#8217;s built-in volume 
  level, press the buttons on the remote in the following sequence:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>S, TV, 0, 2, 8, ENT, DVD, S, TV, VOL+, ENT</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remote can also be used to control other audio and video devices. Refer 
  to the instructions that came with the remote for further information.</p>
<h4>Network Setup </h4>
<p>When your SLIMP3 player and remote control are connected and ready to go, you&#8217;re 
  ready to set up your SLIMP3 player on your network. </p>
<p>Plug in the SLIMP3 player. It will display a welcome greeting followed by a 
  screen reading:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>Would you like to set up the player?<br />
    &gt; No, proceed with startup</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Press the UP or DOWN arrow button on the remote to scroll through the choices 
  on the bottom line. When the second line reads:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>&gt; Yes, go to setup menu</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>press the RIGHT arrow button on the remote to choose that option. </p>
<p>The next screen reads:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>Please choose a configuration method<br />
    &gt; Completely automatic (DHCP &amp; SlimDP)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p> If your network already has a DHCP server (this is usually a feature of a 
  cable or DSL router) and the SLIMP3 server computer is on the same local network 
  as the player, then press RIGHT again so the SLIMP3 player can set itself up 
  completely automatically. You are done!</p>
<p>If you need to specify an IP address for your server (because it&#8217;s on 
  another network or you have more than one SLIMP3 server computer on your network), 
  press the DOWN button until you see &#8220;<code>Specify server manually</code>&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t use a DHCP server, press the DOWN button again until you 
  see &#8220;<code>Enter everything manually</code>&#8221;, then press the RIGHT 
  button. You&#8217;ll need to enter the IP addresses to use for the server and/or 
  player, as well as the &#8220;Subnet Mask&#8221; or &#8220;Netmask&#8221; for 
  your network and the &#8220;Gateway&#8221; or router address. (These values 
  can usually be found in the ethernet network settings area on your computer.)</p>
<p>Use the UP and DOWN arrow buttons to change the digits in the IP address values, 
  and press the RIGHT or LEFT buttons to move between digits. When you have finished 
  with a screen, press the OK button on the remote.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve finished setting up your networking, press the RIGHT arrow 
  button and start using your SLIMP3.</p>
