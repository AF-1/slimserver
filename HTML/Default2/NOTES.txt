I built Default2 by doing "cp -a ExBrowse2 Default2" and then hitting the CSS and Javascript repeatedly with a hammer.

Default2 notes:
- Status and playlist - seem to work, still no power on/off, and the styling isn't quite right
- Home and browsedb - almost pixel-perfect :)
- Browse - I think it works, but if you have problems with ExBrowse2 then you'll have problems here
- Settings, help - seem OK
- Browse artwork - Probably works, haven't done any code changes
- slimserver.css - Here there be dragons. Desparately needs a code cleanup
- html/images - haven't cleaned out the old icons; some of them are still referenced (i.e. by browsedb_artwork)
