                                Welcome to SlimServer 
   
This document describes the steps for installing the SlimServer on Unix-like 
platforms.

Version 5.6 or higher of Perl is required.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Linux Notes:

If you've installed the RPM on a RedHat or Mandrake Linux system, you can start 
the server with this command:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/slimserver start

and stop it with this:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/slimserver stop
	
	
Note: The default installation of Perl on Red Hat 9.0 doesn't include Time::HiRes
 as it should. There's a binary perl-Time-HiRes-1.38-3.i386.rpm RPM on disk 2 of 
 the RedHat install that works fine and is what you need to get the SLIMP3 server 
 running under RH9. Slim Devices also hosts a copy of the appropriate file. 
 As root, use this command to install it from the net:

rpm -i http://www.slimdevices.com/downloads/misc/perl-Time-HiRes-1.38-3.i386.rpm

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FreeBSD Notes:

In a normal installation of FreeBSD the version of Perl is 5.00 and not 
sufficient for use with the SlimServer software, which requires 5.6 or greater.

To upgrade Perl to 5.8:

First become the superuser, then issue the following commands

# cd /usr/ports/lang/perl5.8
# make install clean
# rehash
# use.perl port

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you aren't installing the RPM, you can start the server from a command line 
with the following command:

   ./slimserver.pl --daemon
   
This will start up the server and run itself in the background.

Visit the URL that's printed out with your web browser to configure your 
SlimServer and see the complete documentation.
