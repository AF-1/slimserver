			<li>Fix Bug 424: Songinfo download link crashes server when no client found.
			<li>Fix Bug 423 where a bad function call would crash the server after selecting a mood.
			<li>Fix a problem where a truncated MP3 file could cause the server to lock up and each a lot of CPU power.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Documentation
		<ul>
			<li>Updated FAQ in online documentation.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Squeezebox Firmware Version 29
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a problem where Squeezebox would not unpause properly if paused for a long time on some systems.
			<li>Fixed a problem on some players where Squeezebox would reboot if there was some spurious infrared activity.
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="v5.2.0" id="v5.2.0"></a>Version 5.2.0 - 2004-06-25</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Streaming to MP3 Players
		<ul>
			<li>Added bitrate limiting - the ability to set a maximum bitrate to be streamed to a device. Based on the bitrate, we may transcode to a low(er) bitrate MP3 than the original source, if LAME is installed.
			<li>Preference page in Server Settings to control and view maximum bitrate and conversion settings for music formats.
			<li>Wired Squeezebox have no bandwidth limit, wireless ones default to 320kb.
			<li>Did some work on fixing the problem of some receivers not syncing up properly at the beginning of tracks. The silence mp3 data that I had created had the wrong sample rate. Now when we scan through a file or try to jump to the middle, try to line up on MP3 frame boundries. This should keep the S/PDIF receivers from dropping out.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Files and formats
		<ul>
			<li>Improved performance with scanning the music folder.
			<li>Richard Purdie added a TTL (Time to Live) field. This is used to see when the file was last checked for changes.
			<li>Add data sources (Moodlogic, iTunes, MusicFolder) can be used at the same time.
			<li>Fix several song count errors. All these changes should leave the song counters much more robust.
			<li>Fixed a problem where tags scanned from AAC files ripped with iTunes didn't convert UTF8 encoded tag information into Latin1.
			<li>Fixed bug where wmadec output needed to be byte swapped by lame.
			<li>Fixed problem decoding Apple Lossless encoded files.
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Firmware: A fairly big firmware upgrade (now v.27) that should make network performance (especially uncompressed streaming over wireless) a lot better.
		<ul>
			<li>TCP changes: - enable keep alive transmissions every 60 seconds when idle. This keeps the data stream open while playback is paused (zero rx window).
			<li>Tweaking memory timing fixed the problem where some players would not take a firmware update if the wireless card was installed. May fix other bugs that seem to be player-specific, eg audio glitches, TCP timeouts.
			<li>Fixed crash when attempting to locate the server again if it disappears.
			<li>Changed "re-discovery" mechanism so it continues trying to contact the "last known" IP on port 3483 while also attempting discovery in case the server has moved.
			<li>Changed timeout on control connection to 20s instead of 10s to prevent needless re-connections if the server blocks for a little while.
			<li>Fixed possible channel swap in PCM mode.
			<li>Fix incorrect buffer emptiness calculation that was causing it to play an extra little clip when the buffer plays our or underruns.
			<li>Fix sporadic swapping of channels when unpausing in PCM mode. Caused by incorrect syncrhonization of the data stream with respect to the output frame clock.
			<li>Fix click when going between PCM tracks, caused by sometimes sending all-ones instead of all zeroes.

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Installation
		<ul>
			<li>On Windows, slimsvc.exe and slim.exe have been replaced with a asingle executable, slim.exe which can run as a windows service or "interactively".
			<li>Several updates and improvements to Windows installation should make it a lot smoother when you're upgrading.
			<li>Fix for windows installer that correctly uninstalls the old service even if we're installing into a new location.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Plugins
		<ul>
			<li>Several fixes to the SHOUTcast plugin, including some crashing bugs and improvements: you can now customize the Genres you see, it works correctly with mutiple clients. 
			<li>Plugins can now expose their own web interface. Don't be surprised if you see new home page links when you install plugins.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Web Interface
		<ul>
			<li>Peter Speck's alphabet patch: Miscellaneous special character improvements.
			<li>Kevin Pearsall noticed that web browsers were caching pages too agressively even after we change skins. Now when we first load an item into the html cache, we return a modification time of time() to force expiration of client caches after reload.
			<li>Decide on whether or not to show the Music Folder on the Squeezebox Home screen based on whether we have one defined. 
			<li>Show Saved Playlists directory if the user has a playlist directory defined or they are using itunes or moodlogic.
			<li>Bug313 - Wireless signal strength is now shown at the bottom of the player settings page along with MAC, IP, firmware.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>3rd party software integration:
		<ul>
			<li>SoftSqueeze is now included in the release and better supported by SlimServer thanks to Richard Titmuss.	You can launch it via Java Webstart with the URL: <a href="http://localhost:9000/EN/html/softsqueeze/webstart.html">http://localhost:9000/EN/html/softsqueeze/webstart.html</a> or view it as an applet with this URL: <a href="http://localhost:9000/EN/html/softsqueeze/applet.html">http://localhost:9000/EN/html/softsqueeze/applet.html</a>.
			<li>Richard Titmuss fixed a problem where SoftSqueeze wasn't being sync'ed properly with real hardware players.
			<li>Moodlogic and and iTunes now have their own settings pages if they are installed.
			<li>KDF made extensive improvements to MoodLogic integration, including exporting user and auto playlists, more control over remixing, support for multiple file types in playlists, rescan interval setting.
			<li>Improved iTunes interaction: unchecked iTunes tracks are not ignored, better autolocation of the iTunes library, 
			<li>Apple broke the importing of protected AAC files, so we disable that file type. :-(
			<li>Fix bug 299, allowing rescan button to work even for moodlogic, itunes.
			<li>Slimserver will no longer issue a message if audiodir is blank, so long as either moodlogic or itunes import are in use.
			<li>John Bent sent a patch for xPL: The patch prevents xPL instances from appearing on the network with spaces in them.
			<li>Change Zeroconf/Rendezvous names to be legal for HTTP and CLI interfaces, now: _slimhttp._tcp and _slimcli._tcp as well as the existing _http._tcp

<h2><a name="v5.1.3" id="v5.1.3"></a>Version 5.1.3 - 2004-4-16</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Plugins
		<ul>
			<li>The SHOUTcast brower plugin, originally written by Peter Heslin is included in the standard release.</li>
			<li>We added a few more modules from CPAN, including libwww, File::Temp and Compress:Zlib to our release, which should make it easier for folks to write plugins</li>
			<li>Plugins can now be configured to reside at the Home menu level if desired.  Default to doing so with the SHOUTcast pluging for new users.
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Localization & Internationalization
		<ul>
			<li>Added contributed patch by Peter Speck for some Danish characters.
			<li>Peter Nou updated the Swedish translations.  Thanks, Peter!</li>
			<li>Frederic Miserey updated the french localized images, fixed a bug in the remote documentation.
			<li>More updates from Frederic Miserey on the default skin, including moving the power on/off button up a bit, placing the french remote help in the right folder and cleaning up the html in the Default skin.
			<li>Frederic Miserey fixed some problems with the French localization of the installer.

		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Player Interface
		<ul>
			<li>Accepted patch that reduce custom character flicker from Phil Barrett
			<li>Fixed a problem where the bitrate displayed for some songs was not rounded properly.
			<li>screensaver was not jumping to proper screensaver while playing.  Only ongoing animation, power off, and blocking should stop screensaver.
			<li>screensaver was not jumping to proper screensaver while playing.  Only ongoing animation, power off, and blocking should stop screensaver.
			<li>Fixed several problems with FFWD and REW trick modes.  Seems better about jumping to random locations, but occasionally still won't go back to 1x when we're towards the end of a song.  
			<li>Fixed a problem where players wer resyncing after restart even if master was powered off.  Check the power state for masters as well, and only resync if they are on. For temporary unsync, save settings before issuing the stop command.
			<li>Can now add by artist name again.
			<li>Fix a problem with a deadlock that could cause buffer underruns or stalls with short songs to not get played if the server hits the end of the song while waiting to fill the buffer.			
			<li>fix lists and sorting created by 'ALL_ALBUMS' and/or 'ALL_SONGS' while browsing using the remote.
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>iTunes Support
		<ul>
			<li>Added a server setting to allow folks to set the minimum wait time between iTunes library importing.  The default is (and was) 60.
			<li>Peter Timofejew submitted a patch to not import songs marked as disabled in iTunes.
			<li>Peter Timofejew submitted a patch to fix a problem with automount paths in iTunes XML files.
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>File Formats
		<ul>
			<li>Contributed patch by Guy Albertelli to handle multiple artist and genre names in ID3 tags.
			<li>Accept John Harding's patch to WMA.pm to fix parsing of Track numbers (and probably more).  Dan, please review.
			<li>Updated patch for AIFF files and AIFC files from Caleb Epstein.  We now can extract metadata and play many more AIFF and AIFC files.
			<li>Rob Funk submitted a patch that ignores punctuation for the purposes of sorting.
			<li>Extract more ID3 tag information from QuickTime movies and AAC files, especially those ripped with iTunes.
			<li>Fixed a problem for files that have [ and ] chars in filename
			<li>Split multi-value ID3 tags by / as well as the ; and \0 we had before
			<li>Add multiple tag support for Composer and Band			
			<li>Frederic Miserey noticed that we weren't extracting the number of discs in a set from Movie/AAC metadata.  Fixed.
			<li>Accepted Peter Speck's patch for fixing the bug in that failed to detect missing binaries used in transcoding. Also, Peter patched up some problems in the AIFF parser:
				<ul>
					<li>The sample rate is an 'extended', which is 10 bytes. Only first 6 bytes was read, so $encoding was always garbage.
					<li>Chunks are always an even number of bytes, even if the chunkSize entry is odd (it is null-byte padded).  All my AIFF files have an even chunk size for all chunks except the last chunk, which is an ID3 entry lacking the null-padding. So it have not been a problem for me, just noticed it...
					<li>Removed the redundant tell($f) statements and made the chunk-seeking logic a simple while() loop, which makes the diff big.
					<li>I have renamed chunkoffset to dataoffset, as it is the offset of the sound data, and not the offset of the chunk.
				</ul>
			<li>Updated the convert.conf file so that when LAME is invoked to encode into MP3, we force to resample at a 44.1k sample rate.  Some non-standard sample rates were causing LAME to fail.
			<li>Kevin Pearsall found that convert.conf file had some extraneous "1" options in the oggdec entries, which breaks under the latest oggdec.
			<li>Reformatted types.conf to remove tabs to make it easier for folks to edit.
			<li>Applied patch for FLAC cue files to play to the end.
			<li>We now check to see if the appropriate binaries are available and skip any configurations that require specific binaries.  The syntax of the convert.conf file has been changed slightly, now binaries are expressed as [binaryname] instead of $binaryname$
			<li>Older config files that use the $binaryname$ format should still work, but won't get run-time checks for the presence of the binaries.
			<li>Squeezebox also "prefers" MP3 conversion when possible on wireless, uncompress when wired.  Use the File Formats page in Additional Server Settings to override this behavior.  All of this is to make life easier for new customers who are trying to get AAC and other non-MP3 formats working with the least amount of messing. Out of the box, the behavior is similar as it was, but if you install LAME, it will try to use it unless you disable that line in the configuration.
			<li>Jason Holtzapple submitted a patch that makes cue sheets for FLAC work.  Requires the very latest FLAC to work. 
			<li>Accepted patch from Henry Mason that uses MovieExport data procs in mov123.  This supports more file types under QuickTime.
			<li>More sanity checking in the WAV package to handle some malformed WAV files.
			<li>Fixed a problem where we sometimes weren't switching between PCM and MP3 modes between different file types.
			<li>Track current directory and artwork during scan. Don't search if we already know the cover and thumb in that dir.
			<li>Robert Moser noted that we don't need to uppercase everything twice.
			<li>Victor Brilon submitted a patch for a more thorough list of artwork filenames
		</ul>
	</li>
	

	
	<li>Web Interface
		<ul>
			<li>The built-in webserver is now HTTP 1.1 compliant, thanks to Dan Sully, so page reloads should be much quicker and overall performance improved
			<li>Stefan Christiansson updated the Touch skin to include settings and an about page.
			<li>Cover artwork images now search large-to-small for cover and small-to-large for thumb sizes.
			<li>We've updated our HTML skins system to use the excellent Template Toolkit. Visit http://www.template-toolkit.org for documentation on Template Toolkit.  <li>Script for converting homebrew templates to Template Toolkit compatible ones.	
			<li>There was a conflict between the parameter used to declare a page title and the parameter used to declare a song title. Changed the page title to "pagetitle" from just "title".
			<li>KDF suggested a patch that fixes errant arrows in the search pages.
			<li>Check to make sure Cache directory is writable or creatable.  If not, just cache in RAM.
			<li>Override uri filter when creating new template objects rather than universally.
			<li>Fixed a problem where all_subfolders link was accidentally included when browsing playlists too
			<li>The ability to create variable artwork filenames is in there, but for full compatibility, there needs to be an option to store them all in a central location. This is now added.  Windows and Linux, by default use $bin/Artwork, while OSX will use $ENV{'HOME'}/Music/Artwork
			<li>Make use of title tag on images in default skin, since we're working on it.		
			<li>Eliminated mysterious extra &lt;html&gt;...&lt;/html&gt; from status.html
			<li>Took out the dead playlist add/play links for Music Folder top level.
			<li>Added a whitespace in songinfo to keep give the location url a bit of room.
			<li>Status and Status Header don't need to show the mute button for non-players, since there is no volume control.
			<li>Clean up some overlapping elements in Player Settings
			<li>Group sync settings to help avoid overlapping again.
			<li>Bring Titleformats back for http players, stream title will show standardTitle so its nice to be able to configure it.
			<li>Fix a missing image in the upgrade page for the Default skin.
			<li>Clarify the upgrade explanation in case of failure.
			<li>Also, reordered the repeat buttons on the default skin to make more sense.  (Another from Fred)
			<li>Dean suggested changes to the scrollrate and scrollpause descriptions.
			<li>changed the setup values to allow zero scrollpause, since it should be working now. 
			<li>duration and durationseconds got mixed together at some point.  This broke the progressbar in Touch and Fishbone. durationseconds is now the duration in seconds, while duration is the song duration in minutes and seconds.
			<li>Added settings page for enabling/disabling convert.conf entries.  Useful if you want to force LAME transcoding if you have a slower network.
			<li>Another patch from Frederic for power status in the Default skin.
			<li>Fixed a problem where the song duration wasn't passed correctly to the XML skin.
			<li>use proper countdown number for sleep time in status
			<li>cleanup songinfo to fit comments in readable space
			<li>tidy up alignment of status_header code
			<li>add support for editing playlists in Fishbone, cleanup the code tabbing.
			<li>Felix Mueller submitted some improvements to his playlist editor.  I modified it a bit to make it work for all saved M3U and PLS playlists.
			<li>Throw a 404 if requested setup page doesn't exist, as in  setup.html?page=bogus
			<li>Throw a 404 if a requested skin does not exist.
			<li>Throw a 404 if no handler found in generateHTTPResponse.
			<li>Add content_type of text/html to error responses, and close socket after sending them.
			<li>constrain image sizes in main views.  default to using 100x100 and 200x200 images.
			<li>songinfo artwork is now a link to the raw full size image.
			<li>A surprising number of the HTML files had DOS line endings, which messes with cvs diff sometimes.  Reverted them to unix line endings.
			<li>{'sleeptime'} and {'sleep'} can be more useful as different values. use {'sleeptime'} for the sleep setting, and {'sleep'} for the time remaining
			<li>Disabled Animation setting because it just confuses folks, breaks stuff, and doesn't really improve things.
			<li>Make guessTags a server formatting setting, user able to add more or re-order
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>Streaming to MP3 Players
		<ul>
			<li>Trying to reduce latency in the HTTP streaming.  Clearing the buffer if the song stops or changes.
		</ul>
	</li>
		
	<li>Command Line & Debugging
		<ul>
			<li>d_itunes_verbose is a valid debug flag, so it should be accepted from the command line as well.
			<li>Safety check on buffersize to prevent crashes from clients that misbehave.
			<li>Fix an errant tab in the strings.txt file that was causing a warning.
			<li>Add --d_http_verbose debugging flag.
			<li>Fixed a harmless warning noticed by Kevin Pearsall.
			<li>Added cli command displaynow to return the contents of the display including any animated and size activity.
			<li>Fix alignment of usage message in slimserver.pl
			<li>Move iTunes artwork scan debug msgs to d_artwork
			<li>Fixed a warning I was seeing sometimes when using the web interface before a player was discovered.
			<li>Add d_artwork debugging option
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>Documentation
		<ul>
			<li>Updated FAQ from Kevin Pearsall.
			<li>Updated FAQ to distinguish Wired from Wireless hardware.
			<li>Updated FAQ with a bunch of new questions.
			<li>Fixed another problem in the example in the CLI documentation.
			<li>Minor tweaks to owner's guide.
			<li>Added cover art information from Pat Farrell to docs.
			
		</ul>
	</li>		

	<li>Macintosh
		<ul>
			<li>Move tag database to ~/Library/Caches/SlimServer under Mac OSX
		</ul
	</li>
	
	<li>Windows
		<ul>
			<li>Added a couple of additional Windows registry keys in the installer to help find the Music library.
			<li>Moodlogic: Thanks to Chris at Moodlogic, we now have a bit more information on what we can make available. Now added two settings to the moodlogic server settings:
			<ul>
				<li>instantMixMax - sets the maximum songs for a playlist.
				<li>varietyCombo - from 0-100 where Lower number means a wider selection of songs and a higher number means a closer match to the song picked.
			</ul>
		
			<li>Moodlogic: Some info that the server uses was not being provided by Moodlogic (ie Bitrate), so use readTags and let moodlogic alter info as it	requires.  readTags also handles artwork, so its no longer needed in Moodlogic.pm
			<li>Adding artwork scanning for Moodlogic
			<li>We now include flac.exe and oggdec.exe for windows in the release for yummy FLAC and Ogg playback.
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Unix/Linux
		<ul>
			<li>Pat Farrell updated the unix Installation.txt file.
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>Squeezebox Firmware - Experimental
		<ul>
			<li>Updated default Squeezebox Firmware to v.10 - no changes from version 8, except that it can be updated to versions 20 and above.
			<li>Firmware v.21 is included for testing, but is not installed by default.  To enable, edit the file Firmware/squeezebox.version and remove the # signs on the last two lines.  The following changes are for version 21:
			<li>This firmware update uses a new mechanism for downloading the firmware and storing it in flash memory. Due to the extent of these changes, this is a one-way upgrade.  - Current SlimServer version is required
			<li>TCP has been enhanced to respond better under packet loss conditions. This should dramatically reduce dropouts when streaming uncompressed audio over wireless. Also, interactive performance is improved. In particular, this should eliminate any small delays in screen updates during an animation sequence (eg push animation, slimtris).	
			<li>There is a new mechanism for transferring firmware upgrade images, which uses slimproto instead of a separate data connection. This provides for a few things, 1)  firmware updates may now be installed over NAT and through firewalls and 2) display updates and status messages can still be communicated during the update process, so we now show a nice progress bar during the download. 3) updates which are interrupted during download or during installation no longer require the failsafe update mode.  Instead, the squeezebox will boot normally using the previous image.
			<li>"Raw" infrared codes are now transmitted to the server. This means that the server will now receive ANY 39KHz infrared signals that the squeezebox receives. This feature is not currently utilized by the server, but is available for potential applications such as keyboard interfaces (webtv keyboards, for example, should work), macros, and controlling the squeezebox in response to other events (eg receiver being turned on).
			<li>Other internal changes: updated OS and drivers, new flash and sram organization, increased ethernet and TCP rx buffers, reduced CPU usage
			<li>Fix buffer overrun condition when streaming from Windows XP machines using Intel ethernet cards that use TCP segmentation offloading
			<li>JVC infrared codes now work correctly
			<li>Fix problem where firmware updates over wireless could occasionally  fail.
			<li>Fixed "Can't alloc netpages for dll" message during setup
			<li>Fix problem where WLAN scan results would disappear if the user backs up  through the setup menu after selecting a wireless network.
			<li>New firmware will report buffer size and fullness rather than read and write pointer.  Account for this in the server.
			<li>Don't complain about the server being gone except when pressing up/down/left/right/power buttons. Before, we would nag about the server on  receiving any kind of NEC-compatible IR signal.
			<li>Adding support for raw IR pass-through so that somebody can make an ssh client using a webtv keyboard.
			<li>Upcoming firmware revisions will use a new update mechanism. We're going to jump to from rev 8 to 20 for the new SDK5-based firmware and that'll be how we tell the difference for the purpose of loading a firmware image.
			<li>Instead of the server connecting to the squeezebox and uploading the image, the new mechanism will use slimproto. This means, among other things, that the control channel stays connected, and we can display a nice status screen during the update. Some changes to slimproto:
			<li>Deprecated client->server opcode: BYE!. We might use this later for  something else. In the mean time, it is still of course supported for  older firmware revs.
		</ul>
	</li>
				
	<li>Lots of bugs listed in the <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/">bug database</a> were fixed:
		<ul>
			<li>Bug 197 - Add 'All Subfolders' link under browse music folder.  To make it simple, its still a link, but it does nothing.  It allows access to playlist commands to add/play/remove/insert the entire library.
			<li>Bug 212 - Missing Documentation.  Adding title tags and filling out the alt tags will give the tooltips requested for the graphic buttons.
			<li>Bug 233 - I accidentally swapped scrollpause and scrollrate EN text
			<li>Bug 208 - titleformat description was out of date.  Used updated string suggested by Kevin Pearsall
			<li>Bug 41 - add 'includeArtist' and 'includeAlbum' to browse_list so that search can show more detailed info for when simpler titleformats are used. This is a dupe of the status_list feature.
			<li>Bug 219 - Phil Barrett suggested a patch  to make the # sign more attractive when in double size.
			<li>Bug 227 - Some dirs can look too much like a URL. 
			<li>Bug 97 - player specific option for transcoding bitrate, validates mp3 bitrates only.
			<li>Bug 27 - make the transcoding to HTTP streams able to be specified in the URL: http://slimserver:9000/stream.mp3?bitrate=128
			<li>Bug 33 - smart bandwidth limitation, transcode only when necessary
			<li>Bug 45 - scroll rate player preference
			<li>Bug 189 - Sync lost between players when powering off one of them sync is now restored when players are powered on.  permanent unsyc now from player settings only.
			<li>Bug 37 - sync POWER commands.  There's a new player option to sync power settings.  Players will power off and on as a group.  changing this setting will affect all players in the group.  Turning this off, will unsync all players that are currently powered off, though they will resync as they are powered back on.
			<li>Bug 185 - Set Last-Modified header, honor If-Modified-Since, etc.
			<li>Bug 221 - Fixed a problem where HTTP clients had some inappropriate player settings in the web interface.
			<li>Bug 46 - the location URL on the song info page should be a full URL This seemed to need to be case insensitive so that windows users who type in an audiodir in lower case, will still match with the songpath, which has uppercase drive letters
			<li>Bug 122 - allow the user to control the timeout when connecting to remote sites.
			<li>Bug 213 - repeating playlist when synched checksync wasn't paying attention to the playmode, so when players were ready, it would skip head.  Now it checks for playmode-stop and will stop the playback.  playmode-play will allow the playback to continue for the next song, or the repeat loopback.
		</ul>
	</li>
		
	<li>Experimental
		<ul>
			<li>Added support for a "silent" setting that should allow slave players that don't actually have audio streamed to them.  This has not been thoroughly tested.
			<li>Added a prototype pitch control.  It only works on Squeezebox now and only with MP3 files, and only after a song is restarted.  But it's a start.
		</ul>

</ul>

<h2><a name="v5.1.1" id="v5.1.1"></a>Version 5.1.1 - 2004-3-3</h2>
<ul>

	<li>Remove a number of annoying, but harmless warning messages.
	
	<li>Fixed bug in mov123 caused AAC audio on Windows to come out in little endian format, causing lots of noise.
	
	<li>There was a sanity check in AIFF file scanning to make sure that the top level chunk size header was 
	smaller than the file size.  Unfortunately, iTunes for Windows creates AIFF files that are 
	insane.
	
	<li>Bumping copyright to 2004
	
	<li>Fixed a bug that would cause AAC files to appear twice when using iTunes and cover art scanning.

	<li>Michael Herger updated the German translations.
	
	<li>Skins have access to the full query parameters, as well as the the magnitude of the currently playing rate.
	
	<li>It turns out that iTunes, when ripping AIFF files tosses ID3 tags in there. Now we know how to look for them.
	
	<li>Performance improvements to scanning cover art when using iTunes.
	
	<li>Stefan Christiansson created the Touch skin, appropriate for large touch-screen displays.
	
	<li>Add the sleep info to the skins, including the XML skin.
	
	<li>Make sure we reset the pause time when appropriate.  Should fix one problem with bogus progress times on radio stations.

	<li>Vidur Apparao needed an init and shutdown function for his upcoming plugin, so we'll add these. 
	Vidur added another neat feature for plugins.  You can create a packaged plugin with lots of dependent
	files by putting it in a folder in the plugins folder.  It simply loads the file Plugin.pm in that folder.
	
	
	<li>Up the remote stream timeout.  Should make some streams more reliable.
	
	<li>Use hard spaces in double height characters to fix centering problems.
	
	<li>Nicolas Guillemain updated the french translation.
	
	<li>Fix crash if Radio Station.pls doesn't exist.
	
	<li>There's no reason (that I can think of) to not accept commands on a stream.mp3 URL.

	is very useful.
	
	<li>Patch from KDF to make sure we only worry about images that have coverart when doing the iTunes coverart scan.

	<li>Fixed another problem with CUE files.  We were inserting the occasional 
	space character between songs.  This forces the MP3 decoder in  SLIMP3 to resync,
	which is usually fine, except with CUE files.  So now, we do some extra work to
	send an even number of bytes of contiguous data.</li>
	
	<li>Another fix for the number button functions when browsing the music library 
	from the remote.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed a problem where we should reset at the beginning of the current playlist
	when we've reached the end even if we've got repeat off.</li>
	
	<li>Make sure we are non-blocking on outgoing HTTP streams for all platforms.</li>
	
	<li>Point the update code to the new domain so it doesn't interfere with our web
	logs.</li>
	
	<li>Make the fade resolution a bit higher which should make pausing and unpausing a bit smoother.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed a problem where the audio would continue if we're buffering while we try to pause.</li>
	
	<li>If we're scanning and you hit pause, don't bother fading.</li>
	
	<li>Added a bunch of obscure Mac file type codes.</li>
	
	<li>If itunes has a song and it is missing some id3 tag information, the content type 
	could have been lost.  Reuse it if we need to.</li>
	
	<li>Default to 320kbps transcode bitrate for all transcoding.  It's cheaper (computationally) and
	transparent to all but the most golden of ears.</li>
	
	<li>When we restore the saved playlist at startup, restore the play position.</li>
	
	<li>Added a path to LAME installed with the iTunes LAME encoder, which is a neat bit of software.</li>
	
	<li>Don't close a streaming HTTP connection if there's just no data.  Close it if it's not connected.</li>

<ul>
	<li>
		Localization
		<ul>
			<li>
				German localization patch from Gernot Ficker.
			</li>
			<li>
				Craig Brannan submitted a patch which I rewrote to allow the user to override the strings files (with files named strings.txt, slimp3-strings.txt and .slimp3-strings.txt) in the executable, home or OSX library directories.
			</li>
			<li>
				Nicolas Guillemain updated the french translation for us. 
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Player Interface
		<ul>
			<li>
				Fixed nasty display problem when browsing an album.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you have the sort by filename option turned on, then you can use the number buttons to jump alphabetically when browsing the file system from the remote. Funny windows quote characters can be mapped to apostrophes.
			</li>
			<li>
				When showing search results, we were sometimes doing funny things to the titles.
			</li>
			<li>
				Rework the rewind and scanning code. Press and hold to start scanning FWD or REW. Press and hold again ( or continue holding) to speed up the scan. Press PAUSE or PLAY or the opposite direction to end scanning. Max out ffwd at 256x 
			<li>
			<li>
				When we get to the end of the playlist and repeat is turned off, stop playing, then reset at the beginning.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed a problem where choosing to play an album in the path: Genre -> All Albums -> specific album wasn't playing the right thing.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed a problem where long, doubled, briefly-displayed lines were jumpy.
			</li>
			<li>
				Added a player setting (available from the Player Settings web page) to have volumes synced as well as the playlist.
			</li>
			<li>
				Felix Mueller discovered and fixed some rounding errors in the progress bar.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Windows
		<ul>
			<li>
				Postulated fix for windows shortcuts not being recursed properly during scans and recursive plays.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Debugging
		<ul>
			<li>
				Give some more warning about missing items requested from HTTP server.
			</li>
			<li>
				Remove an extraneous print command used for debugging.
			</li>
			<li>
				Try harder to update CVS for nightly builds.
			</li>
			<li>
				Use portable strftime formats. Fixes crasher on 10.1.5 and bogus logging on many platforms.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Networking
		<ul>
			<li>
				Don't open up our old port of 1069 anymore. Use the latest client.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Formats
		<ul>
			<li>
				Fixed ogg a bit. Use oggdec instead of ogg123, as it's part of the standard ogg release. Fixed a problem where we weren't quoting the path to ogginfo...
			</li>
			<li>
				The reliable i2c support is, well, unreliable. Turning it off to address the problems we're seeing with player lockup. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Improved performance of transcoding to work on windows.
			</li>
			<li>
				Append .exe to the executable name when looking for the binary.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fix the WAV parser to read and ignore unknown chunks, rather than crapping out.
			</li>
			<li>
				Temporarily added -x option to the LAME command for Ogg playback, as most of this happens on x86 machines. This will be cleaned up later.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Streaming
		<ul>
			<li>
				We may not know if a stream is a playlist or a file or what, so we need to check to see if it's an HTTP URL when browsing and do the right thing.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Performance
		<ul>
			<li>
				Simplify doublesizing. All characters are handled through the hash now. Added accessor functions to add new characters to the hash or update existing ones. Kerning has not changed, except to avoid it if the last character was a digit. Added back in the newTimer return value so that timers can be killed specifically.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed the problem that was locking up players. We were sometimes sending volume commands too often. Now we throttle at 10 per second.
			</li>
			<li>
				Reworked the fade_volume parameters to give a overall time rather than a fade amount per tic.
			</li>
			<li>
				Reworked the persistent syncing code. Fixes a couple of problems including the doubling of playlists upon every server restart.
			</li>
			<li>
				Only select on streaming sources, not pipes because it's not appropriate and it doesn't work on windows.
			</li>
			<li>
				Get rid of the die() calls in stream.pm to keep the server from crashing. We've got a rare bug that was causing death while synced, usually after many hours. It will spew out some diagnostic information so maybe we can figure out what's going on here.
			</li>
			<li>
				We don't need to clear the caches if we are just forgetting about a single item.
			</li>
			<li>
				Ignore reserved folder names if they are indeed only folders.
			</li>
			<li>
				Jason Holtzapple submitted fixes for YEAR and TRACKNUM tags.
			</li>
			<li>
				Sync states are now preserved across server restarts.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Web Interface
		<ul>
			<li>
				Many, many from Kevin for Fishbone.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed problems with cue files. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Put a link to our website so folks that are trying out the software can buy the darned thing.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed a small layout problem in the default status header.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Linux
		<ul>
			<li>
				RPM version numbers can't have - in them, but they can have _
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Automation
		<ul>
			<li>
				The button command was only accepting function names, not button names. Now it accepts button names, and if that doesn't work, looks for the appropriate button function.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed a logic bug in the "listen" cli command.
			</li>
			<li>
				When asking for a player name or address via the CLI, you can pass the ID or the index to get a valid answer.
			</li>
			<li>
				Added CLI command "player ip" to return the ip address.
			</li>
			<li>
				KDF fixed a problem in the CLI where the player name command could crash the server crash.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Firmware
		<ul>
			<li>
				Added a command line option to the firmware updater to change the player's MAC address (which is only really useful if you have the wrong kind of display in your player). Usage: update_firmware.pl --newmac=00:01:02:03:04:05
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Documentation
		<ul>
			<li>
				Make sure the button list is consistent in the HTTP and CLI docs.
			</li>
			<li>
				Point the FAQ at the corporate website for information about wireless.
			</li>
			<li>
				Rober Moser documented his text input module saying: What is this? Docs before code, what could that maniac be thinking?!?
			</li>
			<li>
				I clarified the CLI and HTTP docs to reflect that fact that we usually use MAC addresses to identify players these days.
			</li>
			<li>
				Tweaked the FAQ layout and updated the questions themselves.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		MoodLogic
		<ul>
			<li>
				Patches to fix MoodLogic from Gerald at MoodLogic. Do make sure you have updated to the latest version of MoodLogic if you are using it.
			</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
<hr>
		<h2><a name="v4.2.2" id="v4.2.2"></a>Version 4.2.2</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Mac OS X
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a problem where the installer wouldn't start on pre-Jaguar OS.
				<li>Apple's protected AAC files (.m4p) can't be played, so they shouldn't show up.
			</ul>
			<li>Web Interface
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a problem where some pages were getting truncated.
				<li>Improved performance of  loading playlists in the web inteface.
				<li>Fixed a problem where blank titles might appear in the web browser.
				<li>Fixed a problem where radio station titles might have reverted to the URL.
				<li>Fixes to the Fishbone skin.
			</ul>
			<li>Player Interface

		<h2><a name="v4.2.1" id="v4.2.1"></a>Version 4.2.1</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Mac OS X

			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a problem where certain iTunes playlist would appear empty.
				<li>Fixed the ability to set your rendezvous name to nuthin' to disable rendezvous.

			</ul>
			<li>Unix
			<ul>
				<li>Victor came through with a fix to the RPM for default file ownership.
			</ul>
			<li>Player Interface
			<ul>
				<li>Plugins are sorted like everything else.
				<li>Added shuffle by album to the shuffle menu.
				<li>Fixed the crasher in the Information.pm plugin by disabling the code that assumes there's only one directory with Plugins in it.
				<li>Gave some version numbers to the standard plugins.<br>
				
			</ul>
			<li>Web Interface
			<ul>
				<li>Added support for ID3v2.2 cover art.
				<li>iTunes lies about cover art and says it's JPEG when it's clearly PNG.  We see through this.
				<li>Don't look up cover art if we're browsing a playlist.
				<li>Fixed a problem where the metadata from streaming stations was getting lost.
				<li>Patch from KDF to fix a problem with Fishbone.
			</ul>
			<li>Streaming
			<ul>
				<li>Some web servers lie about content types and call everything text.  We guess the content type from the suffix in this case.  Fixes a bunch of streaming stations.
			</ul>
			<li>Localization &amp; Internationalization
			<ul>
				<li>Updated French translation from Nicolas Guillemain.
			</ul>
			<li>Misc
			<ul>
				<li>Also, updated the reference from Extras to Plugins.
				<li>Consistent handling of IP addresses. We only cache the paddr for a client, rather than the ipaddress and the paddr. When a player's IP address changed, they were getting out of sync and could actually crash the server.  As a side effect, it's a bit more efficient in packet handling.
				<li>Abstract out the defaultName from the given name for a player so we can give it a default name and know if it's using its default name. Looking right at IP addresses isn't the right way Don't keep duplicate (IP address and MAC address based) entries in the client hash.
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p></p>
		<h2><a name="v4.2" id="v4.2"></a>Version 4.2</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Mac OS X
			<ul>
				<li>Added support for AAC (.m4a) and QuickTime Movie files under Mac OS X.  Requires the installation of LAME to work.  Due to restrictions from Apple, Apple Music Store files (.m4p) do not work.
				<li>To work around a bug in the Mac OS X System Preferences application, make the Firmware Updater description field a bit bigger so it doesn't get cut off.
				<li>iTunes now expresses the current Music Library folder, so we use that as a default.
				<li>The 60's playlist has a very funny apostrophe in it, which didn't get converted from unicode properly.  Now it does.

				<li>Mac users can now install plugins in ~/Library/SlimDevices/Plugins and /Library/SlimDevices/Plugins.   They can also install skins in ~/Library/SlimDevices/html and /Library/SlimDevices/html, helper executables (such as LAME) in /Library/SlimDevices/bin and ~/Library/SlimDevices/bin and IR files in ~/Library/SlimDevices/IR and /Library/SlimDevices/IR.
				<li>iTunes playlists with slashes (and other funny characters) in the titles now work correctly.
				<li>If you specify an empty Rendezvous name for your server, it won't start the mDNS responder and thus not appear via Rendezvous.
			</ul>
			<li>Windows			<ul>
				<li>Problems with Windows shortcuts have been improved.
			</ul>
			<li>Unix
			<ul>
				<li>Log files specified from the command line are now appended by default.
				<li>Log file format includes time as well as date.
				<li>RPM has been improved to install server as root, run by the user named &quot;slimp3&quot;.
				<li>SIGHUP causes the server settings file to be reloaded.
				<li>Victor Brilon fixed several issues with the RPM.
			</ul>
			<li>Player Interface
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed the doublesized search entry page nastiness.
				<li>Jacob Potter fixed the Shooter Plugin.
				<li>Fixed a problem with reloads on the SenseMaker skin.
				<li>We now identify players by MAC address, not IP address, so if the IP address changes, the player settings follow it. This change may require you to adjust your player settings again.  
				<li>Robert Moser fixed the dreaded cursor flicker bug!  Stud!
				<li>Added ability to use menu function to go to arbitrary plugin. Example: button = menu_PLUGIN.SlimTris
				<li>Added function to invoke arbitrary function in an arbitrary mode. Example: play.hold = modefunction_PLUGIN.SavePlaylist-&gt;save<br>
				
				<li>You can now shuffle by album or by song.  Press the shuffle button to rotate through these settings.  Courtesy Guy Albertelli II.
				<li>Press and hold the ADD button to play the selection next instead of at the end of the playlist.
				<li>The Information plugin has been updated with a lot more information.
				<li>Don't always jump to the top of Home whenever you navigate there.
				<li>When using the number buttons when browsing the music library, they should scroll proportionally (1 to the top, 0 to the bottom, 2-9 proportionally in between.)
				<li>Added an additional player setting to disable auto brightness control altogether.  This will reduce annoyance in some wives.
				<li>Fixed a problem in song title search results where they weren't sorted.  Now they are.
				<li>Fixed a bug where pressing play on Browse Genres-&gt;SomeGenre-&gt;All Albums-&gt;All Songs would fail.
				<li>When the screen saver kicks in, it should jump to the currently playing song if you are already in the Now Playing playlist.
				<li>Fixed a problem where the current song might be thought to be after the last song.
				<li>Improve the plainTitle to be more friendly for songs that don't have ID3 titles defined.   _ are turned to spaces, HTTP urls are cleaned up and displayed.
				<li>The clock display is centered correctly when in double-height mode.
			</ul>
			<li>File Formats
			<ul>
				<li>A bit of work trying to make ogg playback more robust. 
				<li>Note: LAME doesn't know about every sample rate, nor does it handle mono input well. Transcoding files with these characteristics (11.025ksamples/sec, mono) won't work.
				<li>Fixing Ogg support on the Mac. For some reason, the byte order was being swapped from native order. Now we use native order in both LAME and ogg123.
				<li>Fixed the problem where transcoded songs (Ogg, WAV, AIFF, M4A, etc...) were getting cut off.
				<li>Improved (but not fixed completely) progress information for transcoded songs.
				<li>Did you know that WAV files can have ID3 tags in them?  I didn't, until this morning, cover art and all. Neat.
				<li>Adding composer tag from id3 v2.4 support.
				<li>When available, support for the TSOP, TSOT, TSOA ID3v2.4 tags to provide explicit sorting information for artist, title and album names. 
				<li>Fix some path handling code for both windows and unix.  Look for binaries like ogg123 and lame in the path and some well known places.  Under windows, use the File::Which::which() routine to dig it up.
				<li>We now add a tag to the cache which indicates whether we've loaded the tags from the file. Don't bother reloading if it has been done before.
				<li>We weren't displaying the composer information from ID3 v2.2 tags, just 2.3.
				
				
				
			</ul>
			<li>Web Interface
			<ul>
				<li>Adding contributed Fishbone (Kevin Deane-Freeman) and xml skins (Fred Thomas).
				<li>There is now a built-in debug log facility, available from the web interface.  View the log at: http://server:9000/log.txt  by default the last 100k of log is kept around for viewing.
				<li>There is now an option to disable the adding of composer, band and orchestra entries from ID3 tags to the Artists list.
				<li>Songs can be deleted matching specific genres artists albums or song titles from the current playlist.  This is available in some skins.
				<li>Skins can now tell if the player is off.
				<li>Custom file names can be specified for cover art in the settings.
				<li>Fred Thomas cleaned up the skin files to do the escaping of the player id's in the files themselves instead of in the perl code.
				<li>Removed translation of \ to / in M3U parsing.  This was causing duplicates in song counts and the info database.This was REALLY old code, so I'm not sure if it will break any playlists, but I expect not.
				<li>Case-insentivity and article handling has been speed up and made more consistent.
				<li>File URLs displayed when getting song info under iTunes fixed.
				<li>PLS files can now be renamed from the web interface.
				<li>Statistics changes: Performance improvements in calculations of statististics. We don't calculate the per-list-item statistics unless the skin specifically requests them. We don't display the statistsic in the web interface unless they are available.  The Stats aren't available until the scan is complete.
				<li>Display the ethernet MAC address and IP address on the player settings page.
				<li>Kevin Deane-Freeman updated Fishbone skin.
				<li>Removed some restrictions in the names of playlists.  Now you just can't have control characters, slashes, backslashes or dots in the names.
				<li>Moved transcoding settings to their own settings page.
				<li>Robert Moser updated the button mapping documentation.
				<li>The total time statistic wasn't being reset at the beginning of a rescan.
				<li>Added the ability to adjust parameters for all html (and xml and text pages) in a skin. Create a template file called &quot;include.html&quot; at the root of your skin.  This file is parsed for every html and xml response.  Put a line in it like:<br>
					[SET itemsPerPage 10000000]<br>
					in there to set the items per page to be essentially unlimited. You can also put [EVAL ] items in there if you want to do some calculations or other adjustments for every page.
				<li>Guy Albertelli II submitted a patch that allows us to display artist, album and song counts while browsing by genre artist and album.  Neat.
				<li>Improved the consistency in the UI for handling sync groups in  the player settings page.  Synced players appear as one virtual player.
				<li>Added cover art to missing places in the EN and Default skin, including the browse browse music folder view.
				<li>Clicking on the currently playing song title in the Default skin bring up the song info page
				<li>Don't truncate suffixes in folder names.
				<li>Wake up the brightness if the player starts or stops from the web interface.
				<li>Add All Songs to Album browse page.
				<li>Added Thorston Faltings' Purple skin, which is quite nice.
				<li>Added hitlist page to EN skin.
				<li>Remove the border around the cover art in the default skin.

				<li>The server now checks (by default) every day for software updates and notifies the user.  There's an option to disable this feature in the Additional Server Settings are.
			</ul>
			<li>Streaming
			<ul>
				<li>Robert Moser updated the streaming code to improve blocking under Perl 5.8 on Windows and to make it cleaner all around.
				<li>The URL for streaming from the server to an MP3 player can be &quot;http://server:9000/stream.mp3&quot; or just &quot;http://server:9000/stream&quot;
				<li>CPU usage for streaming has been reduced through optimization.
				<li>Added a SliMP3::Protocol::idle() routine that is safe to call in order to give audio streaming some time while blocked in other areas, such as loading up long song search results. Used for in browseid3 and playlist page generation now.  Could be used elsewhere.Any incoming IR data is queued up later, but other UDP packets are processed immediately.  Don't use this routine if you are in the middle of modifying the playlist.
				<li>Don't allow sync between HTTP and SLIMP3 clients, as it doesn't work.
				<li>Some protocol, i2c and decoder cleanup from Sean.
			</ul>
			<li>Localization &amp; Internationalization
			<ul>
				<li>French localizations have been improved.
				<li>Lieven Hollevoet also provided us with a strings.txt localization tool.  
				<li>Some more German improvments, courtesy Thorston.
			</ul>
			<li>Automation
			<ul>
				<li>Significant improvements and updates to Fred Thomas' XML skin.  There is now XML skin documentation available in the technical documentation area.
				<li>The commands &quot;playlist play &lt;item&gt;&quot;, &quot;playlist add &lt;item&gt;&quot; and &quot;playlist insert &lt;item&gt;&quot; now work on songs, playlists or directories.  The &quot;playlist append&quot; and &quot;playlist insertlist&quot; commands are now depricated.
			</ul>
			<li>Documentation
			<ul>
				<li>The printed User Manual has been updated.
				<li>The FAQ has been updated substantially.
				<li>A remote streaming instructions page has been added to the documentation.
			</ul>
			<li>Misc
			<ul>
				<li>Added some additional feedback if firmware update fails.
				<li>The option --d_server prints out details about the stages of startup and shutdown so we <br>
					can see what's taking so long.
				
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<h2><a name="v4.1b1" id="v4.1b1"></a>Version 4.1b1</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Mac OS X
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed support for iTunes 4.0 library importing. (Note: This fixes support for MP3s, AAC is not supported yet.)
				<li>Fixed a problem with firmware updates on Mac OS X version 10.1.5.
				<li>Update the iTunes rescanning to trigger on the file modification date changed and 60 seconds passing since we last finished scanning.
			</ul>
			<li>Windows
			<ul>
				<li>The Windows installer will stop the SLIMP3 service before upgrading.
				<li>Cosmetic improvements to the installer.
				<li>Fixed a problem where Moodlogic could cause the server to stop unexpectedly.
				<li>Fixed a problem where the server could exit if it found a corrupted WAV file during the startup scan.
				<li>Robert Moser provided a fix for a problem with leading slashes in some web links for songs when UNC paths were used to specify a music folder.
			</ul>
			<li>Unix
			<ul>
				<li>Added Rendezvous support for i386-freebsd and i386-openbsd, courtesy Mark Langston.
			</ul>
			<li>Player Interface
			<ul>
				<li>Made sorting a bit smarter for lists of songs (search results and the like) so the songs are now sorted by the title when appropriate.
				<li>Rob Funk suggested a fix to the problem where shuffled playlists didn't shuffle the first track.
				<li>The PAUSE button wasn't properly disabled when the player was off. This meant that you could resume playback without turning on the SLIMP3. Fixed by adding pause.single and pause.hold in the Default.map file.
				<li>Patch accepted to fix time slippage in alarm clock and to fix volume display in alarm clock when in double-height mode.
				<li>When the player is off and the brightness is set to dark, don't reset the brightness unless the user presses the brightness button or turns the player on.
				<li>Performance improvements to fix a problem that was causing server slowdown when double-height text was being displayed.
				<li>Press and hold ADD when browsing the Now Playing playlist to delete the song and move it to the Zapped Songs playlist for further inspection.
			</ul>
			<li>Web Interface
			<ul>
				<li>Added the display of cover art to the song information and browse album screens for the Default and Lite skins. If there's an image in the ID3 tag, use it. If not, then look for a file called cover.jpg, then one called albumartsmall.jpg, then one called folder.jpg in the same folder as the file in question.
				<li>Fixed a problem where jumping to an album title that began with an article would jump you to the wrong place.
				<li>Help pages now have the appropriate look and feel for the default skin.
				<li>There were a couple of extra spaces in popup menus in the setup pages sometimes. Not anymore.
				<li>Rob Funk also suggested that we do allow recursing into playlists in the saved playlist folder, but not in the music folder. He's smart.
				<li>Fixed a dumb problem where LT and GT functionally were switched.
				<li>Adding facility for plugins to have preferences on the plugins page of setup. Plugins using this facility will need a setupGroup procedure which returns a hash ref to the group parameters desired and a hash ref to the preferences to be controlled.
				<li>Added an CSS entry for &lt;code&gt; in the Default css style sheet.
			</ul>
			<li>Streaming
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a number of problems that were causing some streaming stations to fail.
				<li>If an icy-name: header is sent in a remote stream, use that as the name.
			</ul>
			<li>Localization &amp; Internationalization
			<ul>
				<li>Improved German translation from Thorston Faltings.
				<li>Removed some extra spaces from the strings.txt file.
			</ul>
			<li>Automation
			<ul>
				<li>Added the suggested &quot;playlist save&quot; command to save playlists from the command line. Also, added a syntax to load a saved playlist by it's simple name &quot;jazz&quot; instead of &quot;__playlists/jazz.m3u&quot; for simplicity and brevity.
				<li>Added a --d_command option to watch the command execution.

				<li>User Wolfgang Rutter found that iTunes importing breaks if you have perl 5.8 installed and provided a fix.
			</ul>
			<li>Windows
			<ul>
				<li>The Windows options to stop server when quitting are only useful and enabled when not using the Windows service version of the SLIMP3 server software.
				<li>The Windows service would sometimes not respond if there were no players connected. Now we force the server to wake up every second to make sure it's responsive.
				<li>The installer won't prompt for a Library or Playlists folder when upgrading.
			</ul>
			<li>Linux

			</ul>
			<li>Streaming
			<ul>
				<li>The server sends an iTunes-like identifier to streaming stations in order to get them to send to SLIMP3. This fixes many problems with streaming stations.

			<li>Windows
			<ul>
				<li>The SLIMP3 software is now distributed with a Windows-friendly installer thanks to help from Chris Eastwood.
				<li>Fixed some bugs in the SLIMP3 Server application when it connects to a windows service. It now won't try to shut down the service when it quits.
				<li>The Moodlogic support doesn't work with the server when it's run as a Windows service. Moodlogic disabled at service startup. This will be addressed, but in the mean time, use the SLIMP3 Server application to start the server.

			</ul>
			<li>Windows
			<ul>
				<li>Moodlogic added support for their product. Download and install Moodlogic version 2.5 or later and start the SLIMP3 server software. Make sure that Moodlogic is chosen from the Server Settings page and you should be able to browse through your MoodLogic music library, create instant playlists and use the MoodLogic &quot;mood&quot; features. Neat!
			</ul>
			<li>Player Interface:
			<ul>
				<li>The current playlist is preserved across server restarts.
				<li>Fixed a bug where if you pressed the Search button on the remote when in double height mode, it wouldn't update.<br>
				<li>The text on the display didn't show the playlist length when paused, like it does when playing or stopped.
				<li>Reworked the custom character code and the VFD output code. Now you can mix and match custom characters in a given string, setting up their bitmaps only once ever.
				<li>Added support for a new VFD module that has slightly different brightness controls. We'll detect the type of display based on the MAC address.
				<li>Cleaning up the discovery protocol and client creation. There were some cases where players would get stalled and the time would never increase above zero.
				<li>Bump right animation now works in double-height mode.
				<li>Now ignoring duplicate IR packets.
			</ul>
			<li>Web Interface
			<ul>
				<li>The SLIMP3 web interface has a new look, designed by Igor Gasowski, coded by Nick Balestra and Dean Blackketter. The old interface is still available as &quot;SLIMP3 Light&quot; from the Additional Server Settings area.

				<li>index.html and home.html both include the same param information so that we can build frameless skins.
				<li>We now don't send &quot;expires: 0&quot; headers with images.
				<li>Upped the maximum number of tcp connections and connections to scan each time through the main loop. Needed to support the new skin, which is substantially more complicated.

			</ul>
			<li>Automation
			<ul>
				<li>Added support for command-line command: &quot;listen 1&quot; which allows CLI clients to watch the SLIMP3 server events. This includes &quot;raw&quot; infrared codes in this feedback.
				<li>Added support for XML files in the web interface and a future XML skin. You can add .xml files to the html directory and they will be processed using the template mechanism. If you want to create XML for use in the dynamically created pages, replace the .html files with XML equivalents (but retain the .html suffix in the files). Then refer to the files from the HTTP interface with .xml suffixes to ensure that they come back with the right content type.
				<li>Added playerpref commandline/http command to set player preferences.
			</ul>
			<li>Linux/Solaris/Unix:
			<ul>
				<li>Non-mac users can save their &quot;iTunes Music Library.xml&quot; file in their home directory on Unix machines or in the server directory on windows. Make sure the file paths are right, though.
				<li>Patch to add command line option to set user and group if launching as root.

			<li>Player Interface:
			<ul>
				<li>Don't restart the current song when appending a single song while browsing the file system.
				<li>Added a center mark for Treble and Bass controls.

		<ul>
			<li>General
			<ul>
				<li>SliMP3 is no longer spelled SliMP3. With our new identity, it will be SLIMP3.
			</ul>
			<li>Mac OS X:
			<ul>
				<li>The server is now installed as Preference Pane, thanks to Dave Nanian, instead of an Application and now has support for automatically starting up at boot or login time.
				<li>Fixed a bug that didn't display the correct title for URLs and iTunes playlists on the top line when browsing saved playlists and the music library.
				<li>New installations will default to having the CLI turned on. Useful for things like the OSX Remote.
				<li>A German customer found that some of the content in the iTunes Music Library.xml file is localized. We were using the 'Kind' field to determine what kind of data it was. Not good. So now we look at the Mac file type long and the URL and hazard a guess.
				<li>Added a new SLIMP3 Remote application for controlling the playback of the SLIMP3 from a Mac OS X desktop. Thanks to Dave Camp for this contribution.
			</ul>
			<li>Player Interface:
			<ul>
				<li>Added a screen dimming feature. If the player is on, but not playing and not animating, dim the screen until the next IR input. Even though we've never seen any burn-in, this should make some folks more comfortable.
				<li>Optimize playing the Nth song in a playlist from the remote. It was really slow.
				<li>Fixed a a bug where the server could crash when two players are synced and a new song starts.
				<li>Add All Albums and All Songs browsing so you can see a list of all the albums associated with a given Genre or all of the songs listed for a given artist. Particularly useful for compilation albums.
				<li>Default to having a second level Search menu. You can also disable this from the prefs and put the individual search menus back on the top level.
				<li>When displaying the file length, put in commas/periods to make large numbers readable.
				<li>Corrected separators in short date formats.
				<li>When the user browses with the remote and chooses a song in the context of an album, we start playing the whole album starting at that song. To be consistent, we now also play all of the songs in a given directory if you browse in that directory, choose a song and press PLAY. (Note: we don't recurse in this situation, we only look at songs at the current level. If you want to recurse, choose the directory and press PLAY.)
				<li>Added support for pressing PLAY or REC when in the search screens. It will now automatically play or add the search results to the playlist.
				<li>Richard Purdie's cool fix for the streaming CPU hogging bug.
				<li>Added basic support for fast forward and rewind by pressing and holding the FWD and REW keys.
				<li>Included the submitted patch from Gregory Smith that ignores leading articles (The Le Les La Las Los...) for sorting only. You can change which articles to ignore in the advanced settings area.
				<li>Added a volume area to settings. Now you can almost completely control the IR interface with six buttons: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, PLAY, REC
				<li>Added support for multiple IR code sets, including the codeset for our new remote.
				<li>Added BASS and TREBLE controls to the Settings menu, based on a patch from Richard Purdie.
				<li>When browsing an album or a directory via the remote and you press play on a song, it plays the whole album, starting at that point.
				<li>Reworked the IR settings file. There's one file per remote IR code set, so we can handle multiple remotes by adding new .ir files. These files contain IR code to button mappings. New remotes that respond to new codes should have corresponding .ir files created for them.
				<li>There's a new file, Default.map, in the IR directory that contains the button to function mappings. Intrepid users who want to remap the buttons on their remote can modify this file to their liking.
			</ul>
			<li>Web Interface
			<ul>
				<li>Add All Albums and All Songs browsing so you can see a list of all the albums associated with a given Genre or all of the songs listed for a given artist. Particularly useful for compilation albums.
				<li>Added a facility to serve the raw music files via HTTP: Like this: http://myserver:9000/music/virtual/path/to/song.mp3 Only works with songs.
				<li>Fixed many cases where you'd get the funny nested frame problem due to bugs in Opera and Safari.
				<li>Added an HTML template directive: [INCLUDE html/path/here.html] will include the parsed contents of the file in html/path/here.html in the output. Subroutines!
				<li>Hide directory entries that start with __ including our __current.m3u file
				<li>Fixed a couple of it's that should have been its.
				<li>When displaying the file length, put in commas/periods to make large numbers readable.
				<li>Added support for mDNS/Zeroconf/Rendezvous advertising of the SLIMP3 services. Initially supports OS X and one flavor of Linux.
				<li>Changing playlist request through stream.mp3 to match regular syntax. Now use: http://slimserver:9000/stream.mp3?p0=playlist&amp;=load&amp;=playlistpath.m3u&amp; The final &amp; is so that WinAmp doesn't choke on it and is ignored by us. Playlistpath can be an URL escaped full path, an iTunes playlist URL (URL escaped), or a naked playlist name from the Saved Playlist directory.
				<li>Added x-p0 through x-p4 to the HTTP headers in responses to that you can query and get information using the executecommand() syntax, also used by the CLI.
				<li>Added a &quot;Previous&quot; button on the status page.
				<li>Sorting of artists albums and song titles ignores articles like &quot;The&quot; and &quot;La&quot;. You can change which articles to ignore in the advanced settings area.
				<li>Added ability to move items in the playlist around in the Moser skin.
				<li>Added new advanced settings page for setting debug variables
				<li>When looking at song information from the web interface, return a valid URL for songs, even if they are file URLs.
				<li>Return the values of p0 through p4 as headers in HTTP responses. Useful for using HTTP for interactive control. Also return the selected player name and id
				<li>When you start to play music from the web interface, power up if it's powered off.
				<li>You can download music files from the server using a path like: http://server/Music/path/to/song.mp3
				<li>Added support for multiple skins simultaneously. http://server:9000/Moser/ will show the Moser skin automatically.
			</ul>
			<li>Documentation and Online Help
			<ul>
				<li>Updated FAQ and documentation
				<li>Updated the HTTP documentation for new and previously undocumented commands.
				<li>The technical documentation had references to a command called appendalbum, but it's really called addalbum.
				<li>First pass at merging the FAQ on the website with the FAQ in the documentation. This will also appear on the web site. Needs a new index and more organization.
				<li>Added a FAQ entry identifying the ports that are used so that folks can configure their firewalls more easily.
				<li>Updated the FAQ with a bunch of, you guessed it, frequently asked questions.
			</ul>
			<li>File Formats
			<ul>
				<li>No longer recursing into playlists during scans. We may need a power-user option for this, but the new behavior will help more people than it hurts.
				<li>Improved Ogg Vorbis transcoding support. You need to have the Ogg tools and LAME installed for this to work. Only tested on Unix.
				<li>Adding support for the ID3 tags that describe the album number and number of albums in a multi-disc set, in the same manner that we do for iTunes importing.
				<li>The IR code format was messed up in the previous release, it's fixed, but if you've created custom IR files, you'll have to update them.
			</ul>
			<li>Internationalization and Localization
			<ul>
				<li>Swedish and Danish localizations from Andreas Olsson and Morten Fischer-Madsen
				<li>Andreas found some strings that weren't localizable.
				<li>Improved Dutch Localization courtesy Carel Blast
			</ul>
			<li>Linux/Solaris/Unix:
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed an occasional warning from the Animation module.
				<li>Added FreeBSD notes to the Installation.txt docs.
				<li>Patch from datavortex: changed account to a system account and shell to nologin. - don't add user with default name if the admin changed it.
				<li>When running the server in daemon mode, rename the process &quot;slimp3d&quot;
			</ul>
			<li>Command-line interface:
			<ul>
				<li>Added and documented the &quot;exit&quot; command to the CLI. Closes the connection.
				<li>Added new command line argument, --stdio, which enables CLI interface on standard in/out. Now you can safely put the server into the background from a shell.
			</ul>
			<li>Player Firmware
			<ul>
				<li>Added command line options to update_firmware to specify IP and MAC in interactive mode.
				<li>Calling the latest firmware 2.0b2.
				<li>SliMP3's MAC is now in bytes 12..17 of our UDP header
				<li>Added support for multiple IR code sets, including the codeset for our new remote.
				<li>Pressing and holding the POWER button for a long time (15 seconds) will reboot the player now, so you don't have to unplug the unit to reconfigure.
				<li>Improved the user interface for network settings on the player. You can use the number buttons to enter digits in IP values, use UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT consistently throught the interface, use FWD and REW to skip forward and back a screen at a time.

			<li>Player Interface:
			<ul>
				<li>The sleep button wasn't working properly in double-height mode. The text was on the top line, so you wouldn't see it.
				<li>When displaying a file name, correctly separate file and extension.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Web Interface
			<ul>
				<li>Added a FAQ to the online documentation.
				<li>Improved the Moser skin. Now the arrow links look like buttons. Note that the button appearance looks a ton better in Mozilla 1.1 and IE 5.5 than it does in IE 5.01.
				<li>Added an additional server setting to allow sorting and browsing by file name instead of ID3 tag information. (This was added in b7, but the release notes weren't updated.)
				<li>Fixed some problems in HTML with the documentation.
				<li>Fixed some problems in HTML with the &quot;page bar&quot; listings.
				<li>Fixed a capitalization issue with &quot;Player Settings&quot;
				<li>Minor editing to some of the other help documents.
				<li>Redid the Getting Started help document based on the new getting started flyer.
				<li>Added a {webroot} parameter to the templates for easier absolute references. This is set to &quot;/SLIMP3&quot; if a request comes in with /SLIMP3 as the start of the path. This eliminates the need to use updirs &quot;..&quot; in the on-line documentation. It also corrects some invalid (to people using the /SLIMP3 prefix) absolute references which were pre-existing.
				<li>Fixed all color references in CSS files.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>File Formats
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a problem where only &quot;http://&quot; URLs were working in PLS files.

			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Internet Radio/Streaming
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a problem where redirected URLs for streams were losing their title.
				<li>Fixed a problem where URLs redirected through PLS files were losing their title.

				<li>iTunes users need their imported international characters translated from Unicode to LATIN1.
				<li>Added support for multi-disc sets in iTunes.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Player interface:
			<ul>
				<li>Substantially improved directory loading times when browsing the music library by inlining some routines, removing some unnecessary checks, and special-case shortcutting sorting of non-music items (directories, playlists, shortcuts, etc...)
				<li>Stop playing if we haven't heard back from a player in 30 seconds or more.
				<li>Reset the screensaver timer when we come out of Block'ed mode.
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>If a user doesn't have a playlist directory specified, don't let them try to save.
				<li>When browsing the music library, don't try to show a sorted navigation bar in large directories, as the sorting can be quite confused.
				<li>Added a user warning when renaming a playlist fails.
				<li>Fixed a bug where deleting tracks from shuffled playlists wasn't cool.

		<h2><a name="v3.0b6">Version 3.0b6, Released 2002-10-15</a></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Windows:
			<ul>
				<li>The SLIMP3 Server executable couldn't kill the server process on Win98 because 98 puts the process name in all upper case. It can now.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Mac OS X:
			<ul>
				<li>Enable support for Composer field (as an additional artist) for iTunes users.
				<li>When we are scanning the iTunes library, don't tell the user they can browse the music library, because they can't.
				<li>Fixed a problem with the ID3 library where iTunes has some ID3 tags that have spaces in the tag name. We now allow a space.
				<li>Fixed a problem in iTunes where multi-line comments would cause the parser to get confused.
				<li>New users get a reasonable default for the path to their Music Library and their Playlist folder. (Namely: /Users/name/Music/ for both).
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Player interface:
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a problem where pressing STOP didn't always stop the playback immediately.
				<li>Some work on the garbage display bug. We now correctly force the display back into 8 bit mode with every display update. If the bug happens in a particular frame, it will be repaired in the next frame.
				<li>When a new song starts, stop any scrolling and animation for all synced players so that the correct song information is displayed.
				<li>Fixed a cosmetic bug that happend with double-sized characters when the first character was an S.
				<li>Improved the display code to reduce the amount of processing, and number of bytes sent (especially when there's a cursor). There's still a bug somewhere (maybe in the VFD display itself) where the cursor flashes randomly on the screen occasionally.
				<li>Fixed the Welcome To SLIMP3 screen to work again when the server or the player restarts.
				<li>Fixed a problem where changing the brightness when in double-sized broke.
				<li>Fixing the double-height right arrow, K and N characters.
				<li>Fixed (I think) a problem where we were sometimes dropping stop and pause commands.
				<li>Clean up the custom character code to handle all possible bitmaps, improve performance (a bit), and never send bogus data to the player.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Web Interface
			<ul>
				<li>If the songs in a specified album have duplicate track numbers, then sort by artist first. This makes &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; work out better. If there are not duplicate track numbers, then sort by track number first, which makes compilation albums sort properly.
				<li>If there are two albums with the same title, sort the songs by artist first.
				<li>Removed Games setting in Advanced Server settings, as it isn't needed. Use the new Home menu editing facility.
				<li>Don't show duplicate songs in albums.
				<li>Fixed a broken link to the CLI documentation.
				<li>Fix a typo that made searching for songs via the web interface crash the server.
				<li>Fixed a missing space in the playlist template for songs.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>File formats
			<ul>
				<li>Included the patch to support YEAR GENRE and COMMENT in CUE files.
				<li>Clean up of caching of track data to make CUE files work a little better.
				<li>CUE file entries weren't going into the genre cache. Now they are.
				<li>There are a couple of situations where we mean to merge in new meta information not replace it altogether. So now we do that.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Internet Radio/Streaming
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed shoutcast metadata display.
				<li>Fixed HTTP streaming (from the SLIMP3 server) to work reliably.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Linux/Solaris/Unix:
			<ul>
				<li>Included submitted solaris build information by Mike Arnold.
				<li>Included submitted patch for relocatable RPM support by Mike Arnold.

			<li>Firmware
			<ul>
				<li>Updated firmware to version 1.3b2 to fix possible problems with corrupted display data
				<li>Removed display init on sleep wakeup
				<li>Removed LCD_CLEAR when displaying ICMP unreachable
				<li>Changed LCD packet parsing to check for ==0x02 or ==0x03, instead of just checking the two last bits. Removed support for the wait command.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Miscellaneous
			<ul>
				<li>The ends of songs were being cut off when we had mulitple players synced. We should allow for quite a few chunks of silence to be pre-queued when resyncing at the end of song.
				<li>Fixed the display of all LATIN1 characters. We don't have a full character set in the player, so we map as closely as possible.
				<li>Disabling UTF8 support for now. It wasn't making things much better.
				<li>Calculate the content type from the path name unless we've already got one. This fixes some problems with saving playlists.
				<li>A variety of performance optimizations to reduce overall CPU usage.
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<h2><a name="v3.0b5">Version 3.0b5, Released 2002-10-01</a></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Windows:
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a problem where Windows .lnk files wouldn't work properly.
				<li>The Windows shell application now can quit and leave the server running. There's a new preference for this as well as a menu choice to set it. This choice is confirmed if you have confirm turned on.
				<li>Use the &quot;Bagpuss&quot; look as the default on Windows.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Mac OS X:
			<ul>
				<li>The OS X application now shows the status of the server (on or off) by changing the icon on the dock and on the SLIMP3 Server main window.
				<li>Fixed a problem where if a user was using the iTunes importing feature,they couldn't browse their saved playlists unless they turned off iTunes support and then turned it on again.
				<li>The OS X application menus were cleaned up. There's now a menu choice and keyboard equivalent to start and stop the server.
				<li>The OS X application automatically starts the server when it launches.
				<li>iTunes users now get their iTunes playlists along with the other saved playlists. These are read-only, due to the one-way importing of the iTunes library information.
				<li>Somehow the firmware updater menu got disabled in the OS X application. Re-enabled it.
				<li>The OS X application displays the server status more reliably.
				<li>iTunes gets unhappy (and starts ripping songs as &quot;Uknown&quot; if you keep its library file open when it tries to write to it. So we open it and read the whole darned thing in at once and then parse it from memory. Which is faster anyways.
				<li>Warn the user that scanning is still happening for iTunes too.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Player interface:
			<ul>
				<li>Bingo! Killed the garbage character bug that was plaguing 1.3b4 firmware. The problem wasn't in the firmware, rather the server was sending a control code t that was causing some problems on the client. Removed that code and as a bonus, cleaned up how we send brightness commands.
				<li>Jeff Bain submitted some tweaks to the double-size characters and layout. Lookin' good!
				<li>Fixing bugs in synchronization: Unsyncing the master was broken, unsyncing sometimes didn't stop the audio right away.
				<li>Rework the 1.3 streaming code to stall out less often. We also stop scanning (and other background tasks) if the client's buffer runs below half full.
				<li>Disable repeated buttons, including Volume when the player is &quot;off&quot;.
				<li>Fixed a problem where pressing pause in quick succession would cause things to lock up badly.
				<li>Saved Playlists should come right after Music Library from the remote.
				<li>Fade out when we sleep...
				<li>Disable the syncing of HTTP clients, as it doesn't really work.
				<li>Add song information about which ID3 tags we are using.
				<li>Improved animation behavior under load. We now skip frames when appropriate and check the timers before and after handling client streaming.
				<li>Turn the timeout used by the streaming protocol for the 1.3 firmware way down so the queue doesn't stall for so long when we drop a packet.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Web Interface
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a problem added in 3.0b5 that would sometimes show a &quot;please set up your playlists&quot; screen when trying to save the current playlist.
				<li>Updated the sorting used when browsing the music library so it sorts by artist, album, track number and title, in that order.
				<li>We no longer throttle the scan, so we shouldn't tell the user that we do in the advanced server settings.
				<li>Fixed a word in the text displayed when the server doesn't know about any player.
				<li>You can now customize the Home menu int the &quot;Additional Server Settings&quot; area, courtesy RMoser.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Internet Radio/Streaming
			<ul>
				<li>On occasion, streaming radio connections were left open for a long time. Consolidated the closing of open files and streams to fix this.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Linux/Unix:
			<ul>
				<li>RPM: make sure the new slimp3 user doesn't have a home directory
				<li>SLIMP3 lives in /usr/local not /usr/local/bin for the RPMs
				<li>Try and load a system Time::HiRes before the local version.
				<li>We keep around the server scripts when building a release for zipping and tarring.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Command Line Options &amp; Debugging Tools
			<ul>
				<li>Added --streamaddr and --playeraddr command line options to allow the caller to specify which interface to listen on for remote streaming and player UDP.
				<li>Fixed a bug where we weren't keeping track of the last time we went through the idle loop properly.
				<li>Added a bunch of additional debugging output to make monitoring of timing and performance easier.
				<li>Include the d_stream debug flag for debugging the new streaming protocol.
				<li>--d_sync Added a synch debugging flag.
				<li>Added the ability to turn on/off debugging flags from the command line interface. This isn't useful from the remote interface but is very useful from stdio.
				<li>Expose --d_stream_v for verbose stream debugging info. --d_usage shows a 0-9 digit in the rightmost part of the display on 1.3 and a 2 byte hex code on the left on 1.2. We also spit out a percentage to stderr on 1.3
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>HTTP and Command Line Interface Automation
			<ul>
				<li>Updated the CLI documentation to explain the &quot;rescan&quot; (old) and &quot;path&quot; (new) commands. Added the path command to the CLI.
				<li>Fixed a bug that was causing us to ignore parameters after the pause command which we hardly ever used.
				<li>If you put up some text on the screen with the HTTP or CLI interface for longer than a few seconds, the screen would blank and possibly get corrupted. Not anymore.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Miscellaneous
			<ul>
				<li>Firmware files now include version number.
				<li>Updated the pronto CCF file.
				<li>Fixed harmless warning about empty responses when we were sending empty reponses.
				<li>Basic unicode support is enabled.
				<li>Sometimes we were giving some warnings with bad ID3 tags when we tried to get the utf8 version of strings.
				<li>We weren't caching unknown file types, so we would keep trying to figure it out over and over even though we tried once already. This could slow us down a lot.
				<li>Richard Purdie submitted a patch to use a file called ~/.slimp3-strings.txt (on unix) or slimp3-strings.txt (on windows, in the same directory as your prefs file) to override some or all of the standard strings in the strings.txt file. Uses the same format.
